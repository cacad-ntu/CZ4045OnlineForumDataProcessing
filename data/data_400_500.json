Yep, it doesn't change the behavior, like... refactoring?\n\nCertainly there are cases where labels are used incorrectly and should be refactored away. I just don't think it should be treated as some unbreakable rule.\n\nI totally agree. But as you have pointed out, some of us have difficulties while refactoring this example.

It appeared to me that the original poster was unaware of how to use 'continue' and 'break' keywords without labels, but of course, my assumptions may be wrong. \nWhen it comes to performance, the post does not give any information about the implementation of the other functions, so for all I know they might as well be downloading the results via FTP as consisting of simple calculations inlined by the compiler.\nThat being said, doing the same test twice is not optimal\u2014in theory.\nEDIT: On a second thought, the example is actually not a horrible use of labels. I agree that \"goto is a no-no\", but not because of code like this. The use of labels here does not actually affect the readability of the code in a significant way. Of course, they are not required and can easily be omitted, but not using them simply because \"using labels is bad\" is not a good argument in this case. After all, removing the labels does not make the code much easier to read, as others have already commented.\n",

In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).\nTo take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.\nSome help can come from tools like JDepend which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like Structure 101.\nPurely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from \"normal\" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.\nOSGi is a deep and wide component model, documentation I recommend:\n\nOSGi R4 Specification: Get the PDFs of the Core and Compendium specification, they are canonical, authoritative and very readable.

This didn't solve the problem nonetheless.\nI decided to start removing classes from the source tree to see if a could pinpoint the problem.

Now, this class is a monster (as in Frankenstein), it has 167 field members (all of them of type String), 167 getter/setter pairs (1 for each field), a constructor that receives all 167 fields as parameters, an equals method that compares all 167 fields in a strange way. For each field the comparison goes like this:\n\nThe result of this comparison is \"anded\" (&&) with the result of the comparison of the next field, and so on. The class goes on with a hashCode method that also uses all fields, some custom XML serialization methods and a method that returns a Axis-specific metadata object that describes the class and that also uses all field members.\nThis class is never modified, so I just put a compiled version in the application classpath and the project compiled without issues. \nNow, I know that removing this single source file solved the problem.

Still, it is worth looking at the options your class generation tool offers to see if it can produce something less troublesome.\nFix 2: increase the stack size\nI think Kieron has one solution when he mentions the -Xss argument. javac takes a number of non-standard arguments that will vary between versions and compiler vendors.\nMy compiler:\n\nTo list all the options for it, I'd use these commands:\n\nI think the stack limit for javac is 512Kb by default.
