Can you please explain me MathContext in the context of BigDecimal#round method.\n\nThere's nothing special about BigDecimal.round() vs. any other BigDecimal method.  In all cases, the MathContext specifies the number of significant digits and the rounding technique.  Basically, there are two parts of every MathContext.  There's a precision, and there's also a RoundingMode.\nThe precision again specifies the number of significant digits.  So if you specify 123 as a number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you're going to get 120.  It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation.\n123 would be 1.23e2 in scientific notation.  If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get 1.2e2, or 120.  By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number.\nThe RoundingMode part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision.  To reuse the example, if you use 123 as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you've reduced your precision.  With a RoundingMode of HALF_UP (the default mode), 123 will become 120.  With a RoundingMode of CEILING, you'll get 130.\nFor example:\n\nOutputs:\n\nYou can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.\n",

This anti-pattern usually shows itself as a package for something like 'listeners' or 'actions' that groups otherwise unrelated classes simply because they happen to implement the same interface.\nWithin a module, or in a small application, use packages for the application layers. Likely packages include things like the following, depending on the architecture:\n\ncom.mycompany.myapp.view\ncom.mycompany.myapp.model\ncom.mycompany.myapp.services\ncom.mycompany.myapp.rules\ncom.mycompany.myapp.persistence (or 'dao' for data access layer)\ncom.mycompany.myapp.util (beware of this being used as if it were 'misc')\n\nWithin each of these layers, it is natural to group classes by type if there are a lot.

Everything that is domain specific has it's place in the entities module. Now something like a FileStorageStrategy should go into the repositories module, since we don't need to know exactly what the implementation is. In the services layer, we only know the repository interface, we do not care what the specific implementation is (separation of concerns).\nThere are multiple advantages to this approach:\n\nclear separation of concerns\neach module is packageable as a jar (or a war in the case of the web module) and thus allows for easier code reuse (e.g., we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project)\nmaximum independence of each part of the project\n\nI know this doesn't answer all your questions, but I think this could put you on the right path and could prove useful to others.\n",

This should yield two serialized arrays where the array containing the two-byte characters should have length +1.\nPlus if the solution is elegant for Java. \nI can't think of any elegant way to seek for a byte sequence in a byte array.

I think SWT helps Java get over the biggest hurdle for acceptance on the desktop: namely providing a Java application with a consistent, responsive interface that looks like that belonging to any other app on your desktop.  However, I feel that packaging an application is still an issue.  \nOS X natively provides an easy mechanism for wrapping Java apps in native application bundles, but producing an app for Windows/Linux that doesn't require the user to run an ugly batch file or click on a .jar is still a hassle.  Possibly that's not such an issue on Linux, where the user is likely to be a little more tech-savvy, but on Windows I'd like to have a regular .exe for him/her to run.\nHas anyone had any experience with any of the .exe generation tools for Java that are out there?  I've tried JSmooth but had various issues with it.  Is there a better solution before I crack out Visual Studio and roll my own?\nEdit:  I should perhaps mention that I am unable to spend a lot of money on a commercial solution.\n",
