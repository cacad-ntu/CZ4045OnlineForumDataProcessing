When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...\n", 
        "This has religious war potential, but it seems to me that if you're using a getter/setter, you should use it internally as well - using both will lead to maintenance problems down the road (e.g. somebody adds code to a setter that needs to run every time that property is set, and the property is being set internally w/o that setter being called).\n", 
        "It depends on how the property is used. For example, say you have a student object that has a name property. You could use your Get method to pull the name from the database, if it hasn't been retrieved already. This way you are reducing unnecessary calls to the database.\nNow let's say you have a private integer counter in your object that counts the number of times the name has been called. You may want to not use the Get method from inside the object because it would produce an invalid count.\n", 
        "\nAm I just going overboard here?\n\nPerhaps ;)\nAnother approach would be to utilize a private/protected method to actually do the getting (caching/db/etc), and a public wrapper for it that increments the count:\nPHP:\n\nand then from within the object itself:\nPHP:\n\nThis way you can still use that first argument for something else (like sending a flag for whether or not to used cached data here perhaps).\n", 
        "Well, it seems with C# 3.0 properties' default implementation, the decision is taken for you; you HAVE to set the property using the (possibly private) property setter.\nI personally only use the private member-behind when not doing so would cause the object to fall in an less than desirable state, such as when initializing or when caching/lazy loading is involved.\n", 
        "As stated in some of the comments: Sometimes you should, sometimes you shouldn't. The great part about private variables is that you are able to see all the places they are used when you change something. If your getter/setter does something you need, use it. If it doesn't matter you decide.\nThe opposite case could be made that if you use the getter/setter and somebody changes the getter/setter they have to analyze all the places the getter and setter is used internally to see if it messes something up.\n", 
        "Personally, I feel like it's important to remain consistent.  If you have getters and setters, use them.  The only time I would access a field directly is when the accessor has a lot of overhead.  It may feel like you're bloating your code unnecessarily, but it can certainly save a whole lot of headache in the future.  The classic example:\nLater on, you may desire to change the way that field works.  Maybe it should be calculated on-the-fly or maybe you would like to use a different type for the backing store.  If you are accessing properties directly, a change like that can break an awful lot of code in one swell foop.\n",

        "Private fields with public or protected properties.  Access to the values should go through the properties, and be copied to a local variable if they will be used more than once in a method.  If and ONLY if you have the rest of your application so totally tweaked, rocked out, and otherwise optimized to where accessing values by going through their assosciated properties has become a bottleneck (And that will never EVER happen, I guarantee) should you even begin to consider letting anything other than the properties touch their backing variables directly.\n.NET developers can use automatic properties to enforce this since you can't even see the backing variables at design time.\n", 
        "If by \"purist\" you mean \"most encapsulation\", then I typically declare all my fields as private and then use this.field from within the class itself, but all other classes, including subclasses, access instance state using the getters.\n",

        "I like the answer by cmcculloh, but it seems like the most correct is the answer by Greg Hurlman. Use getter/setters all the time if you started using them from the getgo and/or are used to working with them.\nAs an aside, I personally find that using getter/setters makes the code easier to read and to debug later on.\n", 
        "I'm fairly surprised at how unanimous the sentiment is that getters and setters are fine and good. I suggest the incendiary article by Allen Holub \"Getters And Setters Are Evil\". Granted, the title is for shock value, but the author makes valid points.\nEssentially, if you have getters and setters for each and every private field, you are making those fields as good as public. You'd be very hard-pressed to change the type of a private field without ripple effects to every class that calls that getter.\nMoreover, from a strictly OO point of view, objects should be responding to messages (methods) that correspond to their (hopefully) single responsibility. The vast majority of getters and setters don't make sense for their constituent objects;Pen.dispenseInkOnto(Surface) makes more sense to me than Pen.getColor().\nGetters and setters also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data, perform a calculation, and then set some other value in the object, better known as procedural programming. You'd be better served to simply tell the object to do what you were going to in the first place; also known as the Information Expert idiom.\nGetters and setters, however, are necessary evils at the boundary of layers -- UI, persistence, and so forth. Restricted access to a class's internals, such as C++'s friend keyword, Java's package protected access, .NET's internal access, and the Friend Class Pattern can help you reduce the visibility of getters and setters to only those who need them.\n", 
        "The purist OO way is to avoid both and follow the Law of Demeter by using the Tell Don't Ask approach.\nInstead of getting the value of the object's property, which tightly couples the two class, use the object as a parameter e.g.\n\nWhere the property was a native type, e.g. int, use an access method,  name it for problem domain not the programming domain.\n\nThese will allow you to maintain encapsulation and any post-conditions or dependent invariants. You can also use the setter method to maintain any pre-conditions or dependent invariants, however don't fall into the trap of naming them setters, go back to the Hollywood Principle for naming when using the idiom.\n", 
        "PHP offers a myriad of ways to handle this, including magic methods __get and __set, but I prefer explicit getters and setters. Here's why:\n\nValidation can be placed in setters (and getters for that matter)\nIntellisense works with explicit methods\nNo question whether a property is read only, write only or read-write\nRetrieving virtual properties (ie, calculated values) looks the same as regular properties \nYou can easily set an object property that is never actually defined anywhere, which then goes undocumented \n\n",

        "What is the meaning of the Java warning?\n\nType safety: The cast from Object to List is actually checking against the erased type List\n\nI get this warning when I try to cast an Object to a type with generic information, such as in the following code:\n\n", 
        "This warning is there because Java is not actually storing type information at run-time in an object that uses generics.  Thus, if object is actually a List<String>, there will be no ClassCastException at run-time except until an item is accessed from the list that doesn't match the generic type defined in the variable.  \nThis can cause further complications if items are added to the list, with this incorrect generic type information.  Any code still holding a reference to the list but with the correct generic type information will now have an inconsistent list.  \nTo remove the warning, try:\n\nHowever, note that you will not be able to use certain methods such as add because the compiler doesn't know if you are trying to add an object of incorrect type.

        "I was reading More Joel on Software when I came across Joel Spolsky saying something about a particular type of programmer knowing the difference between an int and an Integer in Java/C# (Object Oriented Programming Languages).\nSo, what is the difference?\n", 
        "In Java, the 'int' type is a primitive , whereas the 'Integer' type is an object.\nIn C#, the 'int' type is the same as System.Int32 and is a value type (ie more like the java 'int'). An integer (just like any other value types) can be boxed (\"wrapped\") into an object. \n\nThe differences between objects and primitives are somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but to summarize: \nObjects provide facilities for polymorphism, are passed by reference (or more accurately have references passed by value), and are allocated from the heap. Conversely, primitives are immutable types that are passed by value and are often allocated from the stack.\n", 
        "Well, in Java an int is a primitive while an Integer is an Object. Meaning, if you made a new Integer:\n\nYou could call some method on i:\n\nWhereas with an int:\n\nYou cannot call any methods on it, because it is simply a primitive. So:\n\nwould produce an error, because int is not an object.\nint is one of the few primitives in Java (along with char and some others). I'm not 100% sure, but I'm thinking that the Integer object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property (like the toString() method for example). So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars).\nI know that Java isn't C, but since I've never programmed in C this is the closest I could come to the answer. Hope this helps!\nInteger object javadoc\nInteger Ojbect vs. int primitive comparison\n", 
        "In C#, int is just an alias for System.Int32, string for System.String, double for System.Double etc...\nPersonally I prefer int, string, double, etc. because they don't require a using System; statement :) A silly reason, I know...\n", 
        "I'll add to the excellent answers given above, and talk about boxing and unboxing, and how this applies to Java (although C# has it too). I'll use just Java terminology, because I am more au fait with that.\nAs the answers mentioned, int is just a number (called the unboxed type), whereas Integer is an object (which contains the number, hence a boxed type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on int), you cannot store int or other non-object types in collections (List, Map, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.\nJava 5 onwards have something called auto-boxing and auto-unboxing which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:\n\nJava 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):\n\nIt must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations do happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.\nHope this helps!\n", 
        "I'll just post here since some of the other posts are slightly inaccurate in relation to C#.\nCorrect: int is an alias for System.Int32.\nWrong: float is not an alias for System.Float, but for System.Single\nBasically, int is a reserved keyword in the C# programming language, and is an alias for the System.Int32 value type.\nfloat and Float is not the same however, as the right system type for ''float'' is System.Single. There are some types like this that has reserved keywords that doesn't seem to match the type names directly.\nIn C# there is no difference between ''int'' and ''System.Int32'', or any of the other pairs or keywords/system types, except for when defining enums. With enums you can specify the storage size to use and in this case you can only use the reserved keyword, and not the system runtime type name.\nWether the value in the int will be stored on the stack, in memory, or as a referenced heap object depends on the context and how you use it.\nThis declaration in a method:\n\ndefines a variable i of type System.Int32, living in a register or on the stack, depending on optimizations. The same declaration in a type (struct or class) defines a member field. The same declaration in a method argument list defines a parameter, with the same storage options as for a local variable. (note that this paragraph is not valid if you start pulling iterator methods into the mix, these are different beasts altogether)\nTo get a heap object, you can use boxing:\n\nthis will create a boxed copy of the contents of i on the heap. In IL you can access methods on the heap object directly, but in C# you need to cast it back to an int, which will create another copy. Thus, the object on the heap cannot easily be changed in C# without creating a new boxed copy of a new int value. (Ugh, this paragraph doesn't read all that easily.)\n", 
        "This has already been answered for Java, here's the C# answer:\n\"Integer\" is not a valid type name in C# and \"int\" is just an alias for System.Int32. Also, unlike in Java (or C++) there aren't any special primitive types in C#, every instance of a type in C# (including int) is an object. Here's some demonstrative code:\n\n", 
        "Regarding Java 1.5 and autoboxing there is an important \"quirk\" that comes to play when comparing Integer objects.\nIn Java, Integer objects with the values -128 to 127 are immutable (that is, for one particular integer value, say 23, all Integer objects instantiated through your program with the value 23 points to the exact same object).\nExample, this returns true:\n\nWhile this returns false:\n\nThe == compares by reference (does the variables point to the same object).\nThis result may or may not differ depending on what JVM you are using. The specification autoboxing for Java 1.5 requires that integers (-128 to 127) always box to the same wrapper object. \nA solution? =) One should always use the Integer.equals() method when comparing Integer objects.\n\nMore info at java.net Example at bexhuff.com\n", 
        "In Java there are two basic types in the JVM. 1) Primitive types and 2) Reference Types. int is a primitive type and Integer is a class type (which is kind of reference type).\nPrimitive values do not share state with other primitive values. A variable whose type is a primitive type always holds a primitive value of that type.\n\nAn object is a dynamically created class instance or an array. The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects and a special null reference, which refers to no object. There may be many references to the same object.\n\nAlso in Java everything is passed by value. With objects the value that is passed is the reference to the object. So another difference between int and Integer in java is how they are passed in method calls. For example in\n\nThe variable two is passed as the primitive integer type 2. Whereas in\n\nThe variable two is passed as a reference to an object that holds the integer value 2.\n\n@WolfmanDragon:\nPass by reference would work like so:\n\nWhen increment is called it passes a reference (pointer) to variable a. And the increment function directly modifies variable a.\nAnd for object types it would work as follows:\n\nDo you see the difference now?\n", 
        "One more thing that I don't see in previous answers:\nIn Java the primitive wrappers classes like Integer, Double, Float, Boolean... and String are suposed to be invariant, so that when you pass an instance of those classes the invoked method couldn't alter your data in any way, in opositi\u00f3n with most of other classes, which internal data could be altered by its public methods. So that this classes only has 'getter' methods, no 'setters', besides the constructor.\nIn a java program String literals are stored in a separate portion of heap memory, only a instance for literal, to save memory reusing those instances\n",

Ok, ok. Seriously, last one. If you don't know the baud rate of the device you are trying to communicate with, you have two choices. Start guessing, or possibly bust out an o-scope. If you need a good starting point, let me suggest 9600-8-N-1. My suspicion is you can get there with brute force relatively quickly. There's a third option of having an old-school ninja who can tell just by the LOOK of the garbled characters at some standard baud rate what actual baud rate is. An impressive party trick to be sure.\nHopefully though you have access to this information. In unix/linux, you can get ahold of minicom to play with the serial port directly. This should make it fairly quick to get the configuration figured out.\n\none of the major Unix shells\n\nIn Unix the serial port(s) is/are file-mapped into the /dev/ subdir. ttyS0, for example. If you setup the correct baud rate and whatnot using minicom, you can even cat stuff to that file to send stuff out there.\nOn to the meat of the question, you can access it programmatically through the POSIX headers. termios.h is the big one. \nSee: http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/serial.html#3_1\n(NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE)\n\nbut I also have some interest in serial programming using Windows/Hyperterminal.\n\nHyperterminal and minicom are basically the same program. As for how Windows let's you get access to the serial port, I'll leave that question for someone else. I haven't done that in Windows since the Win95 days.\n", 
        "From the other side, if you want to do it using C#, which will run on both Windows and Linux--with some limitations (EDIT: which may be out of date. I have no way to test it.). Just create a SerialPort object, set its baudrate, port and any other odd settings, call open on it, and write out your byte[]s. After all the setup, the SerialPort object acts very similar to any networked stream, so it should be easy enough to figure out.\nAnd as ibrandy states, you need to know all these settings, like baud rate, before you even start attempting to communicate to any serial device. \n", 
        "At work we use teraterm and realterm for checking serial data is correctly formatted. Also we have a hardware splitter with a switch so we can monitor traffic to our application via a cable back to another port.\nWindows allows you access to the serial port via CreateFile. That gives you a handle and from there you can configure access.\n", 
        "From Java the rxtx (NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE)library is quite good. It picks up where Sun's serial IO framework left off. \n", 
        "For C/C++ on Windows you have (at least) two choices:\n\nUse the SerialPort class provided by .NET.\nUse the Win32 API. There is an extensive MSDN article dating back to 1995, and many free libraries and examples on the web to get you started.\n\nThe .NET option will be much easier.\n", 
        "If you want to code in Java I really recommend SerialIOs SerialPort. It is very easy to use and saves you days of work. I've never found an open source library as good as SerialIO, REALLY!\nMy advice: do not use Sun's serial IO framework! It is from 1998 and full of bugs. You can use rxtx but serialio is better!\n", 
        "If it needs to be cross platfrom, I would suggest looking at Boost Asio.\n", 
        "Awhile back I wrote a decent sized application to route connections from a farm of modems through to a TCP/IP network address.\nInitially I looked for an unencumbered (free) Serial IO library.  I tried Sun's, IBM's and RxTx.  They were fine for developing the application, and in initial testing, but in production they each proved unstable.\nFinally I paid for SerialIO's SerialPort.  Converting over was literally an exercise in changing imports, and the library has been absolutely rock solid - I cannot recommend it enough.  My application has been running in the field 24/7 for a couple of years now, with not a single problem encountered by multiple customers.\nIf you start development using SerialPort, they have a better API and I would use it.\nIf you need cross platform support, Java with SerialPort was the best choice I could find.\nLastly, their licensing is pretty darn reasonable as long as you are not preinstalling software on the equipment for your customer(s).\n", 
        "Depending on the device You are trying to communicate with, there may be more parameters than the baud rate, number of data bits, type of parity checking and number of stop bits to consider. If I recall correctly, modems use nine lines of the RS-232C interface. Some devices like, for example cash registers, may use hardware handshaking on RTS/CTS lines or on DTR/STR lines.  \nIn general it's good to know how the interface works. You can't communicate if the baud rate doesn't match, but wrong setting of other parameters might kind of work. For example You can easily send data to the device expecting 1 stop bit with 2 stop bits set. Problems start when You try to receive data in such case. You can also use appropriately set parity bit as one of stop bits, etc.\n", 
        "I have a simple setter method for a property and null is not appropriate for this particular property. I have always been torn in this situation: should I throw an IllegalArgumentException, or a NullPointerException? From the javadocs, both seem appropriate. Is there some kind of an understood standard?  Or is this just one of those things that you should do whatever you prefer and both are really correct?\n", 
        "It seems like an IllegalArgumentException is called for if you don't want null to be an allowed value, and the NullPointerException would be thrown if you were trying to use a variable that turns out to be null.\n", 
        "If it's a setter method and null is being passed to it, I think it would make more sense to throw an IllegalArgumentException. A NullPointerException seems to make more sense in the case where you're attempting to actually use the null.\nSo, if you're using it and it's null, NullPointer. If it's being passed in and it's null, IllegalArgument.\n", 
        "I tend to follow the design of JDK libraries, especially Collections and Concurrency (Joshua Bloch, Doug Lea, those guys know how to design solid APIs). Anyway, many APIs in the JDK pro-actively throws NullPointerException. \nFor example, the Javadoc for Map.containsKey states:\n\n@throws NullPointerException if the key is null and this map\n    does not permit null keys (optional).\n\nIt's perfectly valid to throw your own NPE. The convention is to include the parameter name which was null in the message of the exception. \nThe pattern goes:\n\nWhatever you do, don't allow a bad value to get set and throw an exception later when other code attempts to use it. That makes debugging a nightmare. You should always the follow the \"fail-fast\" principle.\n", 
        "If you choose to throw a NPE and you are using the argument in your method, it might be redundant and expensive to explicitly check for a null. I think the VM already does that for you.\n", 
        "The accepted practice if to use the IllegalArgumentException( String message ) to declare a parameter to be invalid and give as much detail as possible... So to say that a parameters was found to be null while exception non-null, you would do something like this:\n\nYou have virtually no reason to implicitly use the \"NullPointerException\". The NullPointerException is an exception thrown by the Java Virtual Machine when you try to execute code on null reference (Like toString()).\n", 
        "The standard is to throw the NullPointerException. The generally infallible \"Effective Java\" discusses this briefly in Item 42 (in the first edition) or Item 60 (in the second edition) \"Favor the use of standard exceptions\":\n\n\"Arguably, all erroneous method\n  invocations boil down to an illegal\n  argument or illegal state, but other\n  exceptions are standardly used for\n  certain kinds of illegal arguments and\n  states. If a caller passes null in\n  some parameter for which null values\n  are prohibited, convention dictates\n  that NullPointerException be thrown\n  rather than IllegalArgumentException.\"\n\n", 
        "The definitions from the links to the two exceptions above are\nIllegalArgumentException: Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument. \nNullPointerException: Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an object is required.\nThe big difference here is the IllegalArgumentException is supposed to be used when checking that an argument to a method is valid. NullPointerException is supposed to be used whenever an object being \"used\" when it is null.\nI hope that helps put the two in perspective.\n", 
        "Couldn't agree more with what's being said.  Fail early, fail fast.  Pretty good Exception mantra. \nThe question about which Exception to throw is mostly a matter of personal taste.  In my mind IllegalArgumentException seems more specific than using a NPE since it's telling me that the problem was with an argument I passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method.\nMy 2 Cents\n", 
        "If it's a \"setter\", or somewhere I'm getting a member to use later, I tend to use IllegalArgumentException.\nIf it's something I'm going to use (dereference) right now in the method, I throw a NullPointerException proactively. I like this better than letting the runtime do it, because I can provide a helpful message (seems like the runtime could do this too, but that's a rant for another day).\nIf I'm overriding a method, I use whatever the overridden method uses.\n", 
        "In general, a developer should never throw a NullPointerException. This exception is thrown by the runtime when code attempts to dereference a variable who's value is null. Therefore, if your method wants to explicitly disallow null, as opposed to just happening to have a null value raise a NullPointerException, you should throw an IllegalArgumentException.\n", 
        "You should be using IllegalArgumentException (IAE), not NullPointerException (NPE) for the following reasons:\nFirst, the NPE JavaDoc explicitly lists the cases where NPE is appropriate.  Notice that all of them are thrown by the runtime when null is used inappropriately.  In contrast, the IAE JavaDoc couldn't be more clear: \"Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.\"  Yup, that's you!\nSecond, when you see an NPE in a stack trace, what do you assume?  Probably that someone dereferenced a null.  When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value.  Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading.\nThird, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead?  Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE's separately from IAE and do something different as a result?  Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message?  But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters.\nFourth, all other incorrect parameter data will be IAE, so why not be consistent?  Why is it that an illegal null is so special that it deserves a separate exception from all other types of illegal arguments?\nFinally, I accept the argument given by other answers that parts of the Java API use NPE in this manner.  However, the Java API is inconsistent with everything from exception types to naming conventions, so I think just blindly copying (your favorite part of) the Java API isn't a good enough argument to trump these other considerations.\n", 
        "You should throw an IllegalArgumentException, as it will make it obvious to the programmer that he has done something invalid.  Developers are so used to seeing NPE thrown by the VM, that any programmer would not immediately realize his error, and would start looking around randomly, or worse, blame your code for being 'buggy'.\n", 
        "It's a \"Holy War\" style question. In others words, both alternatives are good, but people will have their preferences which they will defend to the death.\n", 
        "In this case, IllegalArgumentException conveys clear information to the user using your API that the \" should not be null\". As other forum users pointed out you could use NPE if you want to as long as you convey the right information to the user using your API. \nGaryF and tweakt dropped \"Effective Java\" (which I swear by) references which recommends using NPE. And looking at how other good APIs are constructed is the best way to see how to construct your API.\nAnother good example is to look at the Spring APIs. For example, org.springframework.beans.BeanUtils.instantiateClass(Constructor ctor, Object[] args) has a Assert.notNull(ctor, \"Constructor must not be null\") line. org.springframework.util.Assert.notNull(Object object, String message) method checks to see if the argument (object) passed in is null and if it is it throws a new IllegalArgumentException(message) which is then caught in the org.springframework.beans.BeanUtils.instantiateClass(...) method.\n", 
        "What code analysis tools do you use on your Java projects?\nI am interested in all kinds\n\nstatic code analysis tools (FindBugs, PMD, and any others)\ncode coverage tools (Cobertura, Emma, and any others)\nany other instrumentation-based tools \nanything else, if I'm missing something\n\nIf applicable, also state what build tools you use and how well these tools integrate with both your IDEs and build tools. \nIf a tool is only available a specific way (as an IDE plugin, or, say, a build tool plugin) that information is also worth noting.\n", 
        "We use FindBugs and JDepend integrated with Ant. We use JUnit but we're not using any coverage tool. \nI'm not using it integrated to Rational Application Developer (the IDE I'm using to develop J2EE applications) because I like how neat it looks when you run javac in the Windows console. :P\n", 
        "Checkstyle is another one I've used at a previous company... it's mainly for style checking, but it can do some static analysis too.  Also, Clover for code coverage, though be aware it is not a free tool.\n", 
        "We are using FindBugs and Checkstyle as well as Clover for Code Coverage. \nI think it's important to have some kind of static analysis, supporting your development. Unfortunately it's still not widely spread that these tools are important.\n", 
        "I am looking for many answers to learn about new tools and consolidate this knowledge in a one question/thread, so I doubt there will be 1 true answer to this question.\nMy answer to my own question is that we use:\n\nFindbugs to look for common errors bad/coding - run from maven, and also integrates easily into Eclipse\nCobertura for our coverage reports - run from maven\n\nHudson also has a task-scanner plugin that will display a count of your TODO and FIXMEs, as well as show where they are in the source files.\nAll are integrated with Maven 1.x in our case and tied into Hudson, which runs our builds on check-in as well as extra things nightly and weekly. Hudson trend graphs our JUnit tests, coverage, findbugs, as well as open tasks. There is also a Hudson plugin that reports and graphs our compile warnings. We also have several performance tests with their own graphs of performance and memory use over time using the Hudson plots plugin as well.\n", 
        "All of the following we use and integrate easiy in both our Maven 2.x builds and Eclipse/RAD 7:\n\nTesting - JUnit/TestNG\nCode analysis - FindBugs, PMD\nCode coverage - Clover\n\nIn addition, in our Maven builds we have:\n\nJDepend\nTag checker (TODO, FIXME, etc)\n\nFurthermore, if you're using Maven 2.x, CodeHaus has a collection of handy Maven plugins in their Mojo project.\nNote: Clover has out-of-the-box integration with the Bamboo CI server (since they're both Atlassian products). There are also Bamboo plugins for FindBugs, PMD, and CheckStyle but, as noted, the free Hudson CI server has those too.\n", 
        "For static analysis tools I often use CPD, PMD, FindBugs, and Checkstyle.\nCPD is the PMD \"Copy/Paste Detector\" tool. I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the \"Finding Duplicated Code\" link on the PMD web page.\nI'd like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their \"out-of-the-box\" set of rules. And not just because they're open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or \"hooks\" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the \"designer\" tool that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the DescendantToken check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.\nI integrate these tools with an Ant-based build. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.\nIn addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat \"integrated\" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the \"static-analysis\" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a \"unified\" solution? (I've asked this question separately here)\nFirst, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:\n\nThis is often called the \"Emacs format,\" but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:\n\nMy warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant filterchains.\nThe second \"integration\" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write \"SuppressWarning?\"\nFor example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string \"NOPMD\" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's @SuppressWarnings annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing \"SuppressWarning(PMD.\" instead of NOPMD so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:\n\nOnly the \"SuppressWarnings(PMD.\" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the @SuppressWarning annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:\n\nSimilarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings CHECKSTYLE:OFF and CHECKSTYLE:ON, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's \"SuppressionCommentFilter\") to use the strings \"BEGIN\u00a0SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.\" and \"END\u00a0SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.\" makes the controls look more like PMD:\n\nWith Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (HiddenField) is significant because each check has its own \"BEGIN/END\" comment pair.\nFindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a @SuppressWarnings annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom @SuppressWarnings annotation because the built-in Java @SuppressWarnings annotation has a SOURCE retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's @SuppressWarnings annotation:\n\nThese techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string \"SuppressWarnings\" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.\n", 
        "I've had good luck with Cobertura.  It's a code coverage tool which can be executed via your ant script as part of your normal build and can be integrated into Hudson.\n", 
        "I use the static analysis built into IntelliJ IDEA. Perfect integration.\nI use the code coverage built into Intellij IDEA (based on EMMA). Again, perfect integration.\nThis integrated solution is reliable, powerful, and easy-to-use compared to piecing together tools from various vendors.\n", 
        "Our team use PMD and Cobertura, actually our projects are maven projects and there is very simple to include plug ins for code analysis. The real question would be for specific project which analysis you need to use, my opinion is that it's you couldn't use the same plugins for each project.\n", 
        "I use a combination of Cobertura, Checkstyle, (Ecl)Emma and Findbugs.\nEclEmma is an awesome Eclipse plugin that shows the code coverage by coloring the java source in the editor (screenshot) - the coverage is generated by running a JUnit test. This is really useful when you are trying to figure out which lines are covered in a particular class, or if you want to see just which lines are covered by a single test. This is much more user friendly and useful than generating a report and then looking through the report to see which classes have low coverage.\nThe Checkstyle and Findbugs Eclipse plugins are also useful, they generate warnings in the editor as you type.\nMaven2 has report plugins that work with the above tools to generate reports at build time. We use this to get overall project reports, which are more useful when you want aggregate numbers. These are generated by our CI builds, which run using Continuum.\n", 
        "I have an application that writes information to file. This information is used post-execution to determine pass/failure/correctness of the application. I'd like to be able to read the file as it is being written so that I can do these pass/failure/correctness checks in realtime.\nI assume it is possible to do this, but what are the gotchas involved when using Java? If the reading catches up to the writing, will it just wait for more writes up until the file is closed, or will the read throw an exception at this point? If the latter, what do I do then? \nMy intuition is currently pushing me towards BufferedStreams. Is this the way to go?\n",

It may be that the language itself caches writes, waiting until a buffer fills up or file is flushed/closed.\n",

        "The answer seems to be \"no\" ... and \"yes\". There seems to be no real way to know if a file is open for writing by another application. So, reading from such a file will just progress until content is exhausted.

The idea being that it could be started up, then a reader can be started to see how it copes with the \"partial\" file. The reader I wrote is in Reader.java.\nWriter.java\n\nReader.java\n\nNo guarantees that this code is best practice.\nThis leaves the option suggested by Mike of periodically checking if there is new data to be read from the file. This then requires user intervention to close the file reader when it is determined that the reading is completed. Or, the reader needs to be made aware the content of the file and be able to determine and end of write condition. If the content were XML, the end of document could be used to signal this.\n",

My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure \nIf you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first.

Furthermore, java will only autobox to the original type, so it would give a compiler error if you leave the hello(Long) and removed hello(Integer).\n", 
        "In the first case, you have a widening conversion happening. This can be see when runinng the \"javap\" utility program (included w/ the JDK), on the compiled class:\n\nClearly, you see the I2L, which is the mnemonic for the widening Integer-To-Long bytecode instruction. See reference here.\nAnd in the other case, replacing the \"long x\" with the object \"Long x\" signature, you'll have this code in the main method:\n\nSo you see the compiler has created the instruction Integer.valueOf(int), to box the primitive inside the wrapper.\n", 
        "Another interesting thing with this example is the method overloading. The combination of type widening and method overloading only working because the compiler has to make a decision of which method to choose. Consider the following example:\n\nIt doesn't use the run-time type which is List, it uses the compile-time type which is Collection and thus prints \"Collection\". \nI encourage your to read Effective Java, which opened my eyes to some corner cases of the JLS.\n",

        "So, in Java, the first line of your constructor HAS to be a call to super... be it implicitly calling super(), or explicitly calling another constructor.  What I want to know is, why can't I put a try block around that?\nMy specific case is that I have a mock class for a test.  There is no default constructor, but I want one to make the tests simpler to read.  I also want to wrap the exceptions thrown from the constructor into a RuntimeException.\nSo, what I want to do is effectively this:\n\nBut Java complains that super isn't the first statement.\nMy workaround:\n\nIs this the best workaround?  Why doesn't Java let me do the former?\n\nMy best guess as to the \"why\" is that Java doesn't want to let me have a constructed object in a potentially inconsistent state... however, in doing a mock, I don't care about that.  It seems I should be able to do the above... or at least I know that the above is safe for my case... or seems as though it should be anyways.\nI am overriding any methods I use from the tested class, so there is no risk that I am using uninitialized variables.\n", 
        "Unfortunately, compilers can't work on theoretical principles, and even though you may know that it is safe in your case, if they allowed it, it would have to be safe for all cases.\nIn other words, the compiler isn't stopping just you, it's stopping everyone, including all those that don't know that it is unsafe and needs special handling. There are probably other reasons for this as well, as all languages usually have ways to do unsafe things if one knows how to deal with them.\nIn C# .NET there are similar provisions, and the only way to declare a constructor that calls a base constructor is this:\n\nin doing so, the base constructor will be called before the body of the constructor, and you cannot change this order.\n", 
        "I don't know how Java is implemented internally, but if the constructor of the superclass throws an exception, then there isn't a instance of the class you extend.  It would be impossible to call the toString() or equals() methods, for example, since they are inherited in most cases.\nJava may allow a try/catch around the super() call in the constructor if 1. you override ALL methods from the superclasses, and 2. you don't use the super.XXX() clause, but that all sounds too complicated to me.\n", 
        "I can't presume to have a deep understanding of Java internals, but it is my understanding that, when a compiler needs to instantiate a derived class, it has to first create the base (and its base before that(...)) and then slap on the extensions made in the subclass. \nSo it is not even the danger of uninited variables or anything like that at all. When you try to do something in the subclass' constructor before the base class' constructor, you are basically asking the compiler to extend a base object instance that doesn't exist yet.\nEdit:In your case, MyClass becomes the base object, and MyClassMock is a subclass.\n",

        "On a recent Java project, we needed a free Java based real-time data plotting utility.  After much searching, we found this tool called the Scientific Graphics Toolkit or SGT from NOAA.  It seemed pretty robust, but we found out that it wasn't terribly configurable.  Or at least not configurable enough to meet our needs.  We ended up digging very deeply into the Java code and reverse engineering the code and changing it all around to make the plot tool look and act the way we wanted it to look and act.  Of course, this killed any chance for future upgrades from NOAA.  \nSo what free or cheap Java based data plotting tools or libraries do you use?\nFollowup:  Thanks for the JFreeChart suggestions.  I checked out their website and it looks like a very nice data charting and plotting utility.  I should have made it clear in my original question that I was looking specifically to plot real-time data.  I corrected my question above to make that point clear.  It appears that JFreeChart support for live data is marginal at best, though.  Any other suggestions out there?\n",

Unfortunately, I had to create some custom data models with appropriate synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions.

        "At work we are currently still using JUnit 3 to run our tests. We have been considering switching over to JUnit 4 for new tests being written but I have been keeping an eye on TestNG for a while now. What experiences have you all had with either JUnit 4 or TestNG, and which seems to work better for very large numbers of tests? Having flexibility in writing tests is also important to us since our functional tests cover a wide aspect and need to be written in a variety of ways to get results.\nOld tests will not be re-written as they do their job just fine. What I would like to see in new tests though is flexibility in the way the test can be written, natural assertions, grouping, and easily distributed test executions.\n", 
        "First I would say, don't rewrite all your tests just to suit the latest fad.  Junit3 works perfectly well, and the introduction of annotations in 4 doesn't buy you very much (in my opinion).  It is much more important that you guys write tests, and it sounds like you do.  \nUse whatever seems most natural and helps you get your work done.\nI can't comment on TestNG b/c I haven't used it.  But I would recommend unitils, a great wrapper for JUnit/TestNG/DBUnit/EasyMock, regardless of which route you take. (It supports all the flavors mentioned above)\n", 
        "I've used both, but I have to agree with Justin Standard that you shouldn't really consider rewriting your existing tests to any new format.  Regardless of the decision, it is pretty trivial to run both.  TestNG strives to be much more configurable than JUnit, but in the end they both work equally well.\nTestNG has a neat feature where you can mark tests as a particular group, and then easily run all tests of a specific group, or exclude tests of a particular group.  Thus you can mark tests that run slowly as in the \"slow\" group and then ignore them when you want quick results.  A suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as \"checkin\" tests which should be run whenever you check new files in.  I never saw such a feature in JUnit, but then again, if you don't have it, you don't REALLY miss it.\nFor all its claims of high configuration, I did run into a corner case the a couple weeks ago where I couldn't do what I wanted to do... I wish I could remember what it is, but I wanted to bring it up so you know that it's not perfect.\nThe biggest advantage TestNG has is annotations... which JUnit added in version 4 anyways.\n", 
        "About a year ago, we had the same problem. I spent sometime considering which move was better, and eventually we realized that TestNG has no 'killer features'. It's nice, and has some features JUnit 4 doesn't have, but we don't need them.\nWe didn't want people to feel uncomfortable writing tests while getting to know TestNG because we wanted them to keep writing a lot of tests.\nAlso, JUnit is pretty much the de-facto standard in the Java world. There's no decent tool that doesn't support it from the box, you can find a lot of help on the web and they added a lot of new features in the past year which shows it's alive.\nWe decided to stick with JUnit and never looked back.\n", 
        "TestNG's biggest draw cards for me include its support test groups, and more importantly - test group dependencies (marking a test as being dependent of a group causes the tests to simply skip running when the dependent group fails).\nTestNG's other big draw cards for me include test parameters, data providers, annotation transformers, and more than anything - the vibrant and responsive user community.\nWhilst on the surface one might not think all of TestNGs features above might not be needed, once you start to understand the flexibility bring to your tests, you'll wonder how you coped with JUnit.\n(disclaimer - I've not used JUnit 4.x at all, so am unable to really comment on advances or new features there).\n", 
        "A couple of additions to Mike Stone's reply:\n1) The most frequent thing I use TestNG's groups for is when I want to run a single test method in a test suite.  I simply add this test to the group \"phil\" and then run this group.  When I was using JUnit 3, I would comment out the entries for all methods but the one I wanted to run in the \"suite\" method, but then would commonly forget to uncomment them before checkin.  With the groups, I no longer have this problem.\n2) Depending on the complexity of the tests, migrating tests from JUnit3 to TestNG can be done somewhat automatically with sed and creating a base class to replace TestCase that static imports all of the TestNG assert methods.\nI have info on my migration from JUnit to TestNG here and here.\n",

Can you please explain me MathContext in the context of BigDecimal#round method.\n\nThere's nothing special about BigDecimal.round() vs. any other BigDecimal method.  In all cases, the MathContext specifies the number of significant digits and the rounding technique.  Basically, there are two parts of every MathContext.  There's a precision, and there's also a RoundingMode.\nThe precision again specifies the number of significant digits.

It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation.\n123 would be 1.23e2 in scientific notation.  If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get 1.2e2, or 120.  By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number.\nThe RoundingMode part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision.  To reuse the example, if you use 123 as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you've reduced your precision.  With a RoundingMode of HALF_UP (the default mode), 123 will become 120.  With a RoundingMode of CEILING, you'll get 130.\nFor example:\n\nOutputs:\n\nYou can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.\n", 
        "First of all, I know how to build a Java application. But I have always been puzzled about where to put my classes. There are proponents for organizing the packages in a strictly domain oriented fashion, others separate by tier.\nI myself have always had problems with a) with naming, b) with placing\n\nWhere do you put your domain specific constants (and what is the best name for such a class)?\nWhere do you put classes for stuff which is both infrastructural and domain specific (for instance I have a FileStorageStrategy class, which stores the files either in the database, or alternatively in database)?\nWhere to put Exceptions?\nAre there any standards to which I can refer?\n\n", 
        "Class names should always be descriptive and self-explanatory. If you have multiple domains of responsibility for your classes then they should probably be refactored.\nLikewise for you packages. They should be grouped by domain of responsibility. Every domain has it's own exceptions.\nGenerally don't sweat it until you get to a point where it is becoming overwhelming and bloated. Then sit down and don't code, just refactor the classes out, compiling regularly to make sure everything works. Then continue as you did before.\n", 
        "Use packages to group related functionality together.\nUsually the top of your package tree is your domain name reversed (com.domain.subdomain) to guarantee uniqueness, and then usually there will be a package for your application. Then subdivide that by related area, so your FileStorageStrategy might go in, say, com.domain.subdomain.myapp.storage, and then there might be specific implementations/subclasses/whatever in com.domain.subdomain.myapp.storage.file and com.domain.subdomain.myapp.storage.database. These names can get pretty long, but import keeps them all at the top of files and IDEs can help to manage that as well.\nExceptions usually go in the same package as the classes that throw them, so if you had, say, FileStorageException it would go in the same package as FileStorageStrategy. Likewise an interface defining constants would be in the same package.\nThere's not really any standard as such, just use common sense, and if it all gets too messy, refactor!\n", 
        "One thing I've done in the past - if I'm extending a class I'll try and follow their conventions. For example, when working with the Spring Framework, I'll have my MVC Controller classes in a package called com.mydomain.myapp.web.servlet.mvc\nIf I'm not extending something I just go with what is simplest. com.mydomain.domain for Domain Objects (although if you have a ton of domain objects this package could get a bit unwieldy).\nFor domain specific constants, I actually put them as public constants in the most related class. For example, if I have a \"Member\" class and have a maximum member name length constant, I put it in the Member class. Some shops make a separate Constants class but I don't see the value in lumping unrelated numbers and strings into a single class. I've seen some other shops try to solve this problem by creating SEPARATE Constants classes, but that just seems like a waste of time and the result is too confusing. Using this setup, a large project with multiple developers will be duplicating constants all over the place.\n", 
        "I like break my classes down into packages that are related to each other.\nFor example:\nModel For database related calls\nView Classes that deal with what you see\nControl Core functionality classes\nUtil Any misc. classes that are used (typically static functions)\netc.\n", 
        "I think keep it simple and don't over think it. Don't over abstract and layer too much. Just keep it neat, and as it grows, refactoring it is trivial. One of the best features of IDEs is refactoring, so why not make use of it and save you brain power for solving problems that are related to your app, rather then meta issues like code organisation.\n", 
        "I'm a huge fan of organized sources, so I always create the following directory structure:\n\nIn /src I'm using the default Java patterns: Package names starting with your domain (org.yourdomain.yourprojectname) and class names reflecting the OOP aspect you're creating with the class (see the other commenters). Common package names like util, model, view, events are useful, too.\nI tend to put constants for a specific topic in an own class, like SessionConstants or ServiceConstants in the same package of the domain classes.\n", 
        "I've really come to like Maven's Standard Directory Layout.\nOne of the key ideas for me is to have two source roots - one for production code and one for test code like so:\n\n(here, both src/main/java and src/test/java are source roots).\nAdvantages:\n\nYour tests have package (or \"default\") level access to your classes under test.\nYou can easily package only your production sources into a JAR by dropping src/test/java as a source root.\n\nOne rule of thumb about class placement and packages:\nGenerally speaking, well structured projects will be free of circular dependencies. Learn when they are bad (and when they are not), and consider a tool like JDepend or SonarJ that will help you eliminate them.\n", 
        "One thing that I found very helpful for unit tests was to have a myApp/src/ and also myApp/test_src/ directories. This way, I can place unit tests in the same packages as the classes they test, and yet I can easily exclude the test cases when I prepare my production installation.\n", 
        "Short answer: draw your system architecture in terms of modules, drawn side-by-side, with each module sliced vertically into layers (e.g. view, model, persistence). Then use a structure like com.mycompany.myapp.somemodule.somelayer, e.g. com.mycompany.myapp.client.view or com.mycompany.myapp.server.model.\nUsing the top level of packages for application modules, in the old-fashioned computer-science sense of modular programming, ought to be obvious. However, on most of the projects I have worked on we end up forgetting to do that, and end up with a mess of packages without that top-level structure. This anti-pattern usually shows itself as a package for something like 'listeners' or 'actions' that groups otherwise unrelated classes simply because they happen to implement the same interface.\nWithin a module, or in a small application, use packages for the application layers. Likely packages include things like the following, depending on the architecture:\n\ncom.mycompany.myapp.view\ncom.mycompany.myapp.model\ncom.mycompany.myapp.services\ncom.mycompany.myapp.rules\ncom.mycompany.myapp.persistence (or 'dao' for data access layer)\ncom.mycompany.myapp.util (beware of this being used as if it were 'misc')\n\nWithin each of these layers, it is natural to group classes by type if there are a lot. A common anti-pattern here is to unnecessarily introduce too many packages and levels of sub-package so that there are only a few classes in each package.\n", 
        "Where I'm working, we're using Maven 2 and we have a pretty nice archetype for our projects. The goal was to obtain a good separation of concerns, thus we defined a project structure using multiple modules (one for each application 'layer'):\n  - common: common code used by the other layers (e.g., i18n)\n  - entities: the domain entities\n  - repositories: this module contains the daos interfaces and implementations\n  - services-intf: interfaces for the services (e.g, UserService, ...) \n  - services-impl: implementations of the services (e.g, UserServiceImpl) \n  - web: everything regarding the web content (e.g., css, jsps, jsf pages, ...)\n  - ws: web services\nEach module has its own dependencies (e.g., repositories could have jpa) and some are project wide (thus they belong in the common module). Dependencies between the different project modules clearly separate things (e.g., the web layer depends on the service layer but doesn't know about the repository layer).\nEach module has its own base package, for example if the application package is \"com.foo.bar\", then we have:\n\nEach module respects the standard maven project structure:\n\nUnit tests for a given layer easily find their place under \\src\\test... Everything that is domain specific has it's place in the entities module. Now something like a FileStorageStrategy should go into the repositories module, since we don't need to know exactly what the implementation is. In the services layer, we only know the repository interface, we do not care what the specific implementation is (separation of concerns).\nThere are multiple advantages to this approach:\n\nclear separation of concerns\neach module is packageable as a jar (or a war in the case of the web module) and thus allows for easier code reuse (e.g., we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project)\nmaximum independence of each part of the project\n\nI know this doesn't answer all your questions, but I think this could put you on the right path and could prove useful to others.\n",

As an example, my current ugly procedure is to inject a character known to require two bytes into the structure before serializing, then replacing the two-byte character with an ASCII character and comparing the serialized array lengths. This should yield two serialized arrays where the array containing the two-byte characters should have length +1.\nPlus if the solution is elegant for Java. \nI can't think of any elegant way to seek for a byte sequence in a byte array.

Can make detecting circular/unwanted dependencies a little easier.\nHelps domain design\nIf you want to add a bean definition, but it doesn't fit well in any of your context files, perhaps there's a new concept or concern emerging? Examples:\n\nSuppose you want to make your Service layer transactional with AOP. Do you add those bean definitions to services.xml, or put them in their own transactionPolicy.xml? Talk it over with your team. Should your transaction policy be pluggable?\nAdd Acegi/Spring Security beans to your controllers.xml file, or create a security.xml context file? Do you have different security requirements for different deployments/environments?\n\nIntegration testing\nYou can wire up a subset of your application for integration testing (ex: given the above files, to test the database you need to create only datasource.xml and persistence.xml beans).\nSpecifically, you can annotate an integration test class as such:\n\nWorks well with Spring IDE's Beans Graph\nHaving lots of focused and well-named context files makes it easy to create custom BeansConfigSets to visualize the layers of your app using Spring IDE's Beans Graph.

Wing is quite right that these should probably be constants (or maybe enums).\nWhat Bruce needs, at it's heart, is simply a lookup table.  He doesn't need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces; he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier.  Turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state.  If they have neither, then they are simply identifiers, and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger.\nYou could build, e.g., Group objects that each contain a set of schedule strings (one for each season), but if all the Group object does is provide lookup functionality, then you've reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion.  If he has to look up the group, and then lookup the schedule, all he has is a two-step lookup table that took longer to code, is more likely to be buggy, and will be harder to maintain.\n",

        "The convention is to avoid labels altogether.\nThere are very, very few valid reasons to use a label for breaking out of a loop. Breaking out is ok, but you can remove the need to break at all by modifying your design a little. In the example you have given, you would extract the 'Lots of code' sections and put them in individual methods with meaningful names. \n\n\nEdit: having seen the actual code in question (over here), I think the use of labels is probably the best way to make the code readable. In most cases using labels is the wrong approach, in this instance, I think it is fine.\n",

I have never used them in practice, I can't think of a case where avoiding them wouldn't result in much more readable code. \nBut if you have to- I think all caps is ok. Most people won't use labelled breaks, so when they see the code, the caps will jump out at them and will force them to realise what is going on. \n",

Then you don't need to label the breaks at all.\n", 
        "The convention I've most seen is simply camel case, like a method name...\n\nbut I've also seen labels prefixed with an underscore\n\nor with lab...\n\nYou can probably sense though from the other answers that you'll be hard-pushed to find a coding standard that says anything other than 'Don't use labels'. The answer then I guess is that you should use whatever style makes sense to you, as long as it's consistent.\n",

When doing non-trivial looping logic, the test to break or continue isn't always neatly at the end of the surrounding block.\n\nYes, cases like this do happen all the time. What are people suggesting I use instead? A boolean condition like this?\n\nYuck!  Refactoring it as a method doesn't alleviate that either:\n\nSure it's a little prettier, but it's still passing around a superfluous boolean.

        "The Gang of Four's Design Patterns uses a word processor as an example for at least a few of their patterns, particularly Composite and Flyweight.\nOther than by using C or C++, could you really use those patterns and the object-oriented overhead they entail to write a high-performing fully featured word processor? \nI know that Eclipse is written in Java but I haven't used it much so I don't know if it's all that fast or as polished as something like Visual Studio, which has a C++ based text editing system.\n\nI only used C++ and Java as examples. The question has more to do with the overhead of having a lot of in-memory objects like you would in an application such as a word processor or even a game. \nDesign patterns promote abstraction at the expense of parsimony even though they usually point out when you might take some kind of performance hit. Word processors and especially games get the most benefit from being as close to the metal as possible. \nI was just wondering if anyone knew of an fast object-oriented word processor or text editor that wasn't written in C++, and whether they'd build one using patterns or would they forgoe a lot of the abstracting away of things?\n",

        "Well, flyweight is a ridiculous pattern to use in a word processor.  IIRC, they had each character being referenced as a object [note: it was for each glyph, which is still crazy because your OS will happily draw that for you].  With a pointer being wider than a character and all the processing associated with indirection, you'd be mad to use that particular pattern that way in a word processor.\nIf you're interested in the design of word processors, I found an article that doesn't address patterns but does look at some of the data structures underlying word processor design and design considerations.\nTry to remember that design patterns are there to make your life easier, not for you to be pure.  There has to be a reason to use a pattern, it has to offer some benefit.\n", 
        "Flyweight really is just a way of conserving resources in situations where there are thousands of objects with intrinsic shared state, so it could be useful in higher level languages than C/C++. Maybe the GoF's example using glyphs in a document was not the best choice to illustrate this pattern.\nI think there's a lot more to building a high performance word processor than just these basic patterns though - not sure whether there is anything in GoF that rules out being able to successfully do this.\nGenerally, Visual Studio (VS) is more advanced and performs significantly better than Eclipse - at least, the versions of VS that I have seen. Eclipse is one of the most impressive Java applications out there though, it runs quite well on more recent machines with lots of RAM.\n", 
        "\nOne of the things you have to remember was that the GoF book was written in the early 90s, when the prevalent OSes did not have extensive graphic libraries.

In at least 2 of those IDEs I have spent some time with the editor code, so I can assure you its all java (and its not easy either). \nVS 2005 was my last experience of visual studio, and even then I thought eclipse was much more responsive (intelliJ doubly so given time to warm up and index). \nNot sure how thats relevant but thats my experience.

        "The point of GoF and patterns in general is to talk about how to do things \"right\" as in correct, not necessarily \"right\" as in right for the circumstances. Where performance is an issue, and you find that no named pattern gives adequate performance, then perhaps you can justify going your own way. But a good knowledge of patterns gives you a \"sensible default\" and will probably mean that you sacrifice clarity / SoC / etc only so much as is necessary to give adequate performance.\nFeeling that you are \"deviating\" from the norm encourages you to a) think twice, and b) comment the non-idiomatic code well.\nPatterns are vital knowledge, but nothing is gospel and you must always apply judgement.\nHaving said all that - I can't think of any reason why you couldn't write a decent text editor using patterns and a modern JDK\n",

Among other things I'll be designing a UI and database schema.\nI'm sure I'll receive some guidance, but I'd like to be able to knock their socks off.  What can I do in the meantime to prepare, and what will I need to keep in mind when I sit down at my computer with the spec?\nA few things to keep in mind: I'm a college student at my first real programming job.  I'll be using Java.  We already have SCM set up with automated testing, etc...so tools are not an issue.\n",

        "Do you know much about OOP?  If so, look into Spring and Hibernate to keep your implementation clean and orthogonal.  If you get that, you should find TDD a good way to keep your design compact and lean, especially since you have \"automated testing\" up and running.\nUPDATE:\nLooking at the first slew of answers, I couldn't disagree more.  Particularly in the Java space, you should find plenty of mentors/resources on working out your application with Objects, not a database-centric approach.  Database design is typically the first step for Microsoft folks (which I do daily, but am in a recovery program, er, Alt.Net).  If you keep the focus on what you need to deliver to a customer and let your ORM figure out how to persist your objects, your design should be better.\n", 
        "I do it the other way around. I find that doing it database-schema-first gets the system stuck in a data-driven-design that is difficult to abstract from persistence. We try to do domain model designs first and then base the database schema on those.\nAnd then there's the infrastructure design: the team should settle on conventions on how to structure the program first and foremost. And then we work together to agree first on a design for the common functionality of the system (e.g., things everyone needs like persistence, logging, etc.). This becomes the framework of the system.\nWe all work on that together first before we split the rest of the functionalities amongst ourselves.\n", 
        "The main thing is being able to abstract the complexity of the system so that you don't get bogged down by it as soon as you start off.\n\nFirst read the spec like a story (skimming through it). Don't stop at every requirement to analyze it right there and then. This will allow you to get an overall picture of the system without too many details. At this point you would start identifying the major functional components of the system. Start putting these down (use a mindmap tool if you like).\nThen take each component and start exploding it (and tying each detail with requirements in the spec document). Do this for all components, till you have covered all requirements.\nNow, you should start looking at relationships between the components, and whether there are repetitions of features or functions across the various components (which you can then pull out to create utility components, or such). Around now, you would have a good detailed map of your requirements in your mind.\nNOW, you should think of designing the database, ER diagrams, Class Design, DFDs, deployment, etc.\n\nThe problem with doing the last step first is that you can get bogged down in the complexity of your system without really gaining an overall understanding in the first place.\n", 
        "I also disagree about starting with the database.  The DB is simply an artifact of how your business objects are persisted.  I don't know of an equivalent in Java, but .Net has stellar tools such as SubSonic that allow your DB design to stay fluid as you iterate through your business objects design.  I'd say first and foremost (even before deciding on what technologies to introduce) focus on the process and identify your nouns and verbs ... then build out from those abstractions.  Hey, it really does work in the \"real world\", just like OOP 101 taught you!\n", 
        "This sounds very much like my first job. Straight out of university, I was asked to design the database and business logic layer, while other people would take care of the UI. Meanwhile the boss was looking over my shoulder, unwilling to let go of what used to be his baby and was now mine, and poking his finger in it. Three years later, developers were fleeing the company and we were still X months away from actually selling anything.\nThe big mistake was in being too ambitious. If this is your first job, you will make mistakes and you will need to change how things work long after you've written them. We had all sorts of features that made the system more complicated than it needed to be, both on the database level and in the API that it presented to other developers. In the end, the whole thing was just far too complicated to support all at once and just died.\nSo my advice:\n\nIf you're not sure about taking on such a big job single-handed, don't. Tell your employers, and get them to find or hire somebody for you to work with who can help you out. If people need to be added to the project, then it should be done near the start rather than after stuff starts going wrong.\nThink very carefully about what the product is for, and to boil it down to the simplest set of requirements you can think of. If the people giving you the spec aren't technical, try to see past what they've written to what will actually work and make money. Talk to customers and salespeople, and understand the market.\nThere's no shame in admitting you're wrong. If it turns out that the entire system needs to be rewritten, because you made some mistake in your first version, then it's better to admit this as soon as possible so you can get to it. Correspondingly, don't try to make an architecture that can anticipate every possible contingency in your first version, because you don't know what every contingency is and will just get it wrong. Write once with an eye to throwing away and starting again - you may not have to, the first version may be fine, but admit it if you do.\n\n", 
        "Split the big system to smaller pieces.\nAnd don't think that it's so complex, because it usually isn't. By thinking too complex it just ruins your thoughts and eventually the design. Some point you just realize that you could do the same thing easier, and then you redesign it.\nAtleast this has been my major mistake in designing.\nKeep it simple!\n", 
        "It has been my experience that Java applications (.NET also) that consider the database last are highly likely to perform poorly when placed into a corporate environment.  You need to really think about your audience.  You didn't say if it was a web app or not.  Either way the infrastructure that you are implementing on is important when considering how you handle your data.\nNo matter what methodology you consider, how you get and save your data and it's impact on performance should be right up there as one of your #1 priorities.\n",

        "I'd suggest thinking about how this application will be used. How will future users work with it? I'm sure you know at least a few things about what this application needs to handle, but my first advice is \"think of the user and what he or she needs\".\nDraw it up on plain paper, thinking of where to section off the code. Remeber not to mix logic with GUI code (common error). This way you will be set to extend your applications reach in the future to servlets and/or applets or whatever platform comes along. Section in layers so that you can respond to large changes faster without rebuilding everything. Layers should not see any other layers than their closest neighbouring layers.\nBegin with true core functionallity. All that time consuming fluff (that will make your project 4 weeks late), wont matter much to the wast majority of users. It can be added later once you are sure you can deliver on time.\nBtw. Even though this has nothing to do with design I'd just like to say that you won't deliver on time. Make a realistic estimate on time consumption and then double it :-) I assume here that you will not be alone in this project and that people will come and go as the project progresses.

After all, removing the labels does not make the code much easier to read, as others have already commented.\n", 
        "This question was not about optimizing the algorithm - but thanks anyway ;-) \nAt the time I wrote it, I considered the labeled continue as a readable solution.\nI asked SO a question about the convention (having the label in all caps or not) for labels in Java.\nBasically every answer told me \"do not use them - there is always a better way! refactor!\". So I posted this question to ask for a more readable (and therefore better?) solution.\nUntil now, I am not completely convinced by the alternatives presented so far.\nPlease don't get me wrong. Labels are evil most of the time. \nBut in my case, the conditional tests are pretty simple and the algorithm is taken from a mathematical paper and therefore very likely to not change in the near future. So I prefer having all the relevant parts visible at once instead of having to scroll to another method named something like checkMatrixAtRow(x).\nEspecially at more complex mathematical algorithms, I find it pretty hard to find \"good\" function-names - but I guess that is yet another question\n",

        "What makes a module/service/bit of application functionality a particularly good candidate for an OSGi module? \nI'm interested in using OSGi in my applications. We're a Java shop and we use Spring pretty extensively, so I'm leaning toward using Spring Dynamic Modules for OSGi(tm) Service Platforms. I'm looking for a good way to incorporate a little bit of OSGi into an application as a trial. Has anyone here used this or a similar OSGi technology? Are there any pitfalls? \n@Nicolas - Thanks, I've seen that one. It's a good tutorial, but I'm looking more for ideas on how to do my first \"real\" OSGi bundle, as opposed to a Hello World example.\n@david - Thanks for the link! Ideally, with a greenfield app, I'd design the whole thing to be dynamic. What I'm looking for right now, though, is to introduce it in a small piece of an existing application. Assuming I can pick any piece of the app, what are some factors to consider that would make that piece better or worse as an OSGi guinea pig?\n", 
        "I really like the Apache Felix tutorials. However, I think in general leveraging OSGi in your application isn't one of those \"let's use this framework, because it's hype\" decision. It's more of a design question, but then everything that OSGi gives you in terms of design, you can have with vanilla Java as well.\nAs for the runtime, you cannot just add an existing application and make it OSGi enabled. It needs to be design to be dynamic. Spring DM makes it easy to hide that from you, but it's still there and you need to be aware of it.\n", 
        "Well, since you can not have one part OSGi and one part non-OSGi you'll need to make your entire app OSGi. In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).\nTo take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.\nSome help can come from tools like JDepend which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like Structure 101.\nPurely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from \"normal\" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.\nOSGi is a deep and wide component model, documentation I recommend:\n\nOSGi R4 Specification: Get the PDFs of the Core and Compendium specification, they are canonical, authoritative and very readable. Have a shortcut to them handy at all times, you will consult them.\nRead up on OSGi best practices, there is a large set of things you can do but a somewhat smaller set of things you should do and there are some things you should never do (DynamicImport: * for example). \n\nSome links: \n\nOSGi best practices and using Apache Felix\nPeter Kriens and BJ Hargrave in a Sun presentation on OSGi best practices \none key OSGi concept are Services, learn why and how they supplant the Listener pattern with the Whiteboard pattern\nThe Spring DM Google Group is very responsive and friendly in my experience\nThe Spring DM Google Group is no longer active and has moved to Eclipse.org as the Gemini Blueprint project which has a forum here.\n\n",

Since the WSDL does not report what WS-Security settings are necessary, you're best off by asking the service provider what is required. WS-Security requirements may be simple plaintext password, or might be X509 certificates, or might be encrypted message..... Rampart should be able to handle most of these scenarios.\nApache Rampart is \"turned on\" by engaging the module in your axis2.xml file.

You need to be careful if you are overriding equals for mutable objects, as many of the collections such as Maps and Sets use equals to determine equivalence, and mutating an object contained in a collection could lead to unexpected results.

        "To be honest, in Java there is not really an argument against overriding equals.

        "@David Schlosnagle mentions mentions Josh Bloch's Effective Java -- this is a must-read for any Java developer.\nThere is a related issue: for immutable value objects, you should also consider overriding compare_to.  The standard wording for if they differ is in the Comparable API:\n\nIt is generally the case, but not strictly required that (compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y)). Generally speaking, any comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.

Still, it is worth looking at the options your class generation tool offers to see if it can produce something less troublesome.\nFix 2: increase the stack size\nI think Kieron has one solution when he mentions the -Xss argument. javac takes a number of non-standard arguments that will vary between versions and compiler vendors.\nMy compiler:\n\nTo list all the options for it, I'd use these commands:\n\nI think the stack limit for javac is 512Kb by default.

If you don't and return s on an exception (where some hvalue isn't completely percent-encoded, you could end up narrowing some wide characters and losing information.

        "I am developing a J2ME application that has a large amount of data to store on the device (in the region of 1MB but variable). I can't rely on the file system so I'm stuck the Record Management System (RMS), which allows multiple record stores but each have a limited size. My initial target platform, Blackberry, limits each to 64KB.\nI'm wondering if anyone else has had to tackle the problem of storing a large amount of data in the RMS and how they managed it? I'm thinking of having to calculate record sizes and split one data set accross multiple stores if its too large, but that adds a lot of complexity to keep it intact.\nThere is lots of different types of data being stored but only one set in particular will exceed the 64KB limit.\n", 
        "I think the most flexible approach would be to implement your own file system on top of the RMS. You can handle the RMS records in a similar way as blocks on a hard drive and use a inode structure or similar to spread logical files over multiple blocks. I would recommend implementing a byte or stream-oriented interface on top of the blocks, and then possibly making another API layer on top of that for writing special data structures (or simply make your objects serializable to the data stream).\nTanenbaum's classical book on operating systems covers how to implement a simple file system, but I am sure you can find other resources online if you don't like paper.\n",

RMS is designed to store small amounts of data (High score tables, or whatever) not large amounts.\nYou might find that some platforms are faster with files stored in multiple record stores. Some are faster with multiple records within one store. Many are ok for storage, but become unusably slow when deleting large amounts of data from the store.\nYour best bet is to use JSR-75 instead where available, and create your own file store interface that falls back to RMS if nothing better is supported.\nUnfortunately when it comes to JavaME, you are often drawn into writing device-specific variants of your code.\n",

The HttpConnection class and the GET and POST methods are always supported.\nOn the handsets that support JSR 75 FileConnection it may be valid alternative but without code signing it is an user experience nightmare. Almost every single API call will invoke a security prompt with no blanket permission choice. Companies that deploy apps with JSR 75 usually need half a dozen binaries for every port just to cover a small part of the possible certificates. And this is just for the manufacturer certificates; some handsets only have carrier-locked certificates.\n",

As pointed out by Carlos this is a problem on any platform and I've had similar issues using the PIM part of it. The RMS seems to be incredibly slow on the Blackberry platform so I'm not sure how useful a inode/b-tree file system on top would be, unless data was cached in memory and written to RMS in a low priority background thread.\n",

Another downside is that in Subversion the standard trunk/tags/branches approach add even more complexity to the repository.\nThe other approach uses a flat structure, where there are only one parent project and all the modules, submodules and parts-of-the-submodules are a direct child of the parent project.

        "Project Darkstar was the topic of the monthly JavaSIG meeting down at the Google offices in NYC last night.  For those that don't know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the \"hard stuff.\"  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.\nApparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.\nNow, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don't think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.\nSecond, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.  Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.\nSo, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time?  Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required?  Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?\n", 
        "I don't work in the games industry, but it sounds to me like this will do the same thing for video games as the Quake and Half-Life engines did. That is they will promote getting young developers interested in the industry and promote development of indie games. \nFrom what I can tell, video game companies do not reuse most of their code, because if they do it implies that their new game is just a rehash of an old one. Everyone wants a cool new physics engine, better graphics, new ways to play the game. Most video game engines and frameworks are made for a specific scenario and thus are not very bendable to other situations. \nMaybe Darkstar will get it right though, but I kinda doubt it, since generalizing only works for so much.\n", 
        "\nFrom what I can tell, video game companies do not reuse most of their code, because if they do it implies that their new game is just a rehash of an old one.\n\nUm... if you're referring to the long tail of video game companies, maybe. Within a company that has had a series of successful games, there is usually some modicum of reuse. Major hardware changes can result in ditching a lot of work, but it really depends on the company.\n", 
        "Sounds like useless tech to me. The MMO world is controlled by a few big game companies that already have their own tech in place. Indie game developers love trying to build MMO's and sometimes they do, but those games rarely gain traction. Larger companies breaking into the MMO world would probably license \"proven\" technology, or extend their own.\nGame companies reuse vast quantities of code from game to game. Most/many game companies have developed their own tech internally, and use it on every game they produce. Occasionally, they will do something like replace their physics code with a 3rd party physics engine. If their internal code base (game engine, design tools, internal pipeline) starts to age too much, or become unwieldy, they might switch to one of the big game engines like Unreal. Even then, major chunks of code will continue to be re-used from game to game.\n",

        "We run DB40 .NET version in a large client/server project.\nOur experiences is that you can potentially get much better performance than typical relational databases.\nHowever, you really have to tweak your objects to get this kind of performance. For example, if you've got a list containing a lot of objects, DB4O activation of these lists is slow. There are a number of ways to get around this problem, for example, by inverting the relationship.\nAnother pain is activation. When you retrieve or delete an object from DB4O, by default it will activate the whole object tree. For example, loading a Foo will load Foo.Bar.Baz.Bat, etc until there's nothing left to load. While this is nice from a programming standpoint, performance will slow down the more nesting in your objects. To improve performance, you can tell DB4O how many levels deep to activate. This is time-consuming to do if you've got a lot of objects.\nAnother area of pain was text searching. DB4O's text searching is far, far slower than SQL full text indexing. (They'll tell you this outright on their site.) The good news is, it's easy to setup a text searching engine on top of DB4O. On our project, we've hooked up Lucene.NET to index the text fields we want.\nSome APIs don't seem to work, such as the GetField APIs useful in applying database upgrades. (For example, you've renamed a property and you want to upgrade your existing objects in the database, you need to use these \"reflection\" APIs to find objects in the database. Other APIs, such as the [Index] attribute don't work in the stable 6.4 version, and you must instead specify indexes using the Configure().Index(\"someField\"), which is not strongly typed.\nWe've witnessed performance degrade the larger your database. We have a 1GB database right now and things are still fast, but not nearly as fast as when we started with a tiny database.\nWe've found another issue where Db4O.GetByID will close the database if the ID doesn't exist anymore in the database.\nWe've found the Native Query syntax (the most natural, language-integrated syntax for queries) is far, far slower than the less-friendly SODA queries. So instead of typing:\n\nInstead of that nice query code, you have to an ugly SODA query which is string-based and not strongly-typed.\nFor .NET folks, they've recently introduced a LINQ-to-DB4O provider, which provides for the best syntax yet.

Their user forums are next to worthless, however, almost all questions go unanswered. Their JIRA bug tracker receives a lot of attention, so if you've got a nagging bug, file it on JIRA on it often will get fixed. (We've had 2 bugs that have been fixed, and another one that got patched in a half-assed way.)\nIf all this hasn't scared you off, let me say that we're very happy with DB4O, despite the problems we've encountered.

To keep going with the mail example, let's say that when we send mail it could fail because you don't have an email address, or it could because you don't have a valid email address, or it could fail.. etc.\nMy code would want to react differently to each of these issues (mostly by changing the message returned to the client, but actual logic as well).\nWould it be best to have an exception implementation for each one of these issues or one umbrella exception that had something internal to it (an enum say) that let the code distinguish what kind of issue it was.\n", 
        "It depends on what your application is doing.

        "In my code, I find that MOST exceptions percolate up to a UI layer where they are caught by my exception handlers which simply display a message to the user (and write to the log). It's an unexpected exception, after all.\nSometimes, I do want to catch a specific exception (as you seem to want to do). You'll probably find, however, that this is somewhat rare and that it is indicative of using exceptions to control logic -- which is inefficient (slow) and often frowned upon.\nSo using your example, if you want to run some special logic when the email server is not configured, you may want to add a method to the emailUtil object like:\npublic bool isEmailConfigured()\n... call that first, instead of looking for a specific exception.\nWhen an exception does happen, it really means that the situation was completely unexpected and the code can't handle it -- so the best you can do is report it to the user (or write it to a log or restart )\nAs for having an exception hierarchy vs exceptions-with-error-codes-in-them, I typically do the latter. It's easier to add new exceptions, if you just need to define a new error constant instead of a whole new class. But, it doesn't matter much as long as you try to be consistent throughout your project.\n", 
        "Instead of using exceptions, I tend to return a list of status objects from methods that may have problems executing.  The status objects contain a severity enum (information, warning, error, ...) a status object name like \"Email Address\" and a user readable message like \"Badly formatted Email Address\"\nThe calling code would then decide which to filter up to the UI and which to handle itself.\nPersonally, I think exceptions are strictly for when you can't implement a normal code solution.  The performance hit and handling restrictions are just a bit too much for me.\nAnother reason for using a list of status objects is that identifying multiple errors (such as during validation) is MUCH easier.  After all, you can only throw one exception which must be handled before moving on.  \nImagine a user submitting an email that had a malformed destination address and contained language that you are blocking.  Do you throw the malformed email exception, then, after they fix that and resubmit, throw a bad language exception?  From a user experience perspective dealing with all of them at once is a better way to go.\nUPDATE: combining answers\n@Jonathan: My point was that I can evaluate the action, in this case sending an email, and send back multiple failure reasons. For example, \"bad email address\", \"blank message title\", etc..\nWith an exception, you're limited to just percolating the one problem then asking the user to resubmit at which point they find out about a second problem. This is really bad UI design.\nReinventing the wheel.. possibly. However, most applications should analyze the whole transaction in order to give the best possible information to the user. Imagine if your compiler stopped dead at the first error. You then fix the error and hit compile again only to have it stop again for a different error. What a pain in the butt. To me, that's exactly the problem with throwing exceptions and hence the reason I said to use a different mechanism.\n",

        "It depends on whether the code that catches the exception needs to differentiate between exceptions or whether you are just using exceptions to fail out to an error page.

But most of the time programmers just use exceptions as a catch all to throw up an error on the web page.  In this case you are just wasting effort on writing a new exception.\n", 
        "I think a combination of the above is going to give you the best result. \nYou can throw different exceptions depending on the problem. e.g. Missing email address = ArgumentException. \nBut then in the UI layer you can check the exception type and, if need be, the message and then display a appropriate message to the user. I personally tend to only show a informational message to the user if a certain type of exception is thrown (UserException in my app). Of course you should scrub and verify user input as much as possible further up the stack to make sure any exceptions are generated by truly unlikely scenarios, not as a filter for malformed emails which can easily be checked with a regex.\nI also wouldn't worry about the performance implications of catching an exception from user input. The only time you are going to see performance problems from exceptions is when they are being thrown and caught in a loop or similar.\n", 
        "I usually start with a general exception and subclass it as needed. I always can catch the general exception (and with it all subclassed exceptions) if needed, but also the specific.\nAn example from the Java-API is IOException, that has subclasses like FileNotFoundException or EOFException (and much more).\nThis way you get the advantages of both, you don't have throw-clauses like:\n\na general\n\nis enough. But if you want to have a special reaction to special circumstances you can always catch the specific exception.\n",

        "The topic says the most of it - what is the reason for the fact that static methods can't be declared in an interface?\n\nThe code above gives me the following error (in Eclipse, at least): \"Illegal modifier for the interface method ITest.test(); only public & abstract are permitted\".\n", 
        "Static methods are not instance methods. There's no instance context, therefore to implement it from the interface makes little sense.\n", 
        "I'll answer your question with an example. Suppose we had a Math class with a static method add. You would call this method like so:\n\nIf Math were an interface instead of a class, it could not have any defined functions. As such, saying something like Math.add(2, 3) makes no sense.\n", 
        "The reason why you can't have a static method in an interface lies in the way Java resolves static references. Java will not bother looking for an instance of a class when attempting to execute a static method. This is because static methods are not instance dependent and hence can be executed straight from the class file. Given that all methods in an interface are abstract, the VM would have to look for a particular implementation of the interface in order to find the code behind the static method so that it could be executed. This then contradicts how static method resolution works and would introduce an inconsistency into the language.\n", 
        "An interface is used for polymorphism, which applies to Objects, not types. Therefore (as already noted) it makes no sense to have an static interface member.\n", 
        "Perhaps a code example would help, I'm going to use C#, but you should be able to follow along.\nLets pretend we have an interface called IPayable\n\nNow, we have two concrete classes that implement this interface:\n\nNow, lets pretend we have a collection of various accounts, to do this we will use a generic list of the type IPayable\n\nNow, we want to pay $50.00 to all those accounts:\n\nSo now you see how interfaces are incredibly useful. \nThey are used on instantiated objects only. Not on static classes. \nIf you had made pay static, when looping through the IPayable's in accountsToPay there would be no way to figure out if it should call pay on BusinessAcount or CustomerAccount.\n", 
        "There are a few issues at play here.  The first is the issue of declaring a static method without defining it.  This is the difference between\n\nand\n\nThe first is impossible for the reasons that Espo mentions: you don't know which implementing class is the correct definition.\nJava could allow the latter; and in fact, starting in Java 8, it does!\n", 
        "The reason lies in the design-principle, that java does not allow multiple inheritance. The problem with multiple inheritance can be illustrated by the following example:\n\nNow what happens if you call C.x()? Will be A.x() or B.x() executed? Every language with multiple inheritance has to solve this problem.\nInterfaces allow in Java some sort of restricted multiple inheritance. To avoid the problem above, they are not allowed to have methods. If we look at the same problem with interfaces and static methods:\n\nSame problem here, what happen if you call C.x()?\n", 
        "Python uses the reference count method to handle object life time. So an object that has no more use will be immediately destroyed.\nBut, in Java, the GC(garbage collector) destroys objects which are no longer used at a specific time.\nWhy does Java choose this strategy and what is the benefit from this?\nIs this better than the Python approach?\n", 
        "I think the article \"Java theory and practice: A brief history of garbage collection\" from IBM should help explain some of the questions you have.\n", 
        "There are drawbacks of using reference counting. One of the most mentioned is circular references: Suppose A references B, B references C and C references B. If A were to drop its reference to B, both B and C will still have a reference count of 1 and won't be deleted with traditional reference counting. CPython (reference counting is not part of python itself, but part of the C implementation thereof) catches circular references with a separate garbage collection routine that it runs periodically...\nAnother drawback: Reference counting can make execution slower. Each time an object is referenced and dereferenced, the interpreter/VM must check to see if the count has gone down to 0 (and then deallocate if it did). Garbage Collection does not need to do this.\nAlso, Garbage Collection can be done in a separate thread (though it can be a bit tricky). On machines with lots of RAM and for processes that use memory only slowly, you might not want to be doing GC at all! Reference counting would be a bit of a drawback there in terms of performance...\n", 
        "Darren Thomas gives a good answer.  However, one big difference between the Java and Python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case (no circular references) objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date.\nFor example, I can write sloppy, non-portable code in CPython such as\n\nand the file descriptor for that file I opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away, the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed.  Of course, if I run Jython or IronPython or possibly PyPy, then the garbage collector won't necessarily run until much later; possibly I'll run out of file descriptors first and my program will crash.\nSo you SHOULD be writing code that looks like\n\nbut sometimes people like to rely on reference counting to always free up their resources because it can sometimes make your code a little shorter.\nI'd say that the best garbage collector is the one with the best performance, which currently seems to be the Java-style generational garbage collectors that can run in a separate thread and has all these crazy optimizations, etc.  The differences to how you write your code should be negligible and ideally non-existent.\n", 
        "The latest Sun Java VM actually have multiple GC algorithms which you can tweak.  The Java VM specifications intentionally omitted specifying actual GC behaviour to allow different (and multiple) GC algorithms for different VMs.\nFor example, for all the people who dislike the \"stop-the-world\" approach of the default Sun Java VM GC behaviour, there are VM such as IBM's WebSphere Real Time which allows real-time application to run on Java.\nSince the Java VM spec is publicly available, there is (theoretically) nothing stopping anyone from implementing a Java VM that uses CPython's GC algorithm.\n", 
        "Reference counting is particularly difficult to do efficiently in a multi-threaded environment. I don't know how you'd even start to do it without getting into hardware assisted transactions or similar (currently) unusual atomic instructions.\nReference counting is easy to implement. JVMs have had a lot of money sunk into competing implementations, so it shouldn't be surprising that they implement very good solutions to very difficult problems. However, it's becoming increasingly easy to target your favourite language at the JVM.\n", 
        "Garbage collection is faster (more time efficient) than reference counting, if you have enough memory. For example, a copying gc traverses the \"live\" objects and copies them to a new space, and can reclaim all the \"dead\" objects in one step by marking a whole memory region. This is very efficient, if you have enough memory. Generational collections use the knowledge that \"most objects die young\"; often only a few percent of objects have to be copied.\n[This is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc/free]\nReference counting is much more space efficient than garbage collection, since it reclaims memory the very moment it gets unreachable. This is nice when you want to attach finalizers to objects (e.g. to close a file once the File object gets unreachable). A reference counting system can work even when only a few percent of the memory is free. But the management cost of having to increment and decrement counters upon each pointer assignment cost a lot of time, and some kind of garbage collection is still needed to reclaim cycles.\nSo the trade-off is clear: if you have to work in a memory-constrained environment, or if you need precise finalizers, use reference counting. If you have enough memory and need the speed, use garbage collection.\n", 
        "Actually reference counting and the strategies used by the Sun JVM are all different types of garbage collection algorithms.\nThere are two broad approaches for tracking down dead objects: tracing and reference counting. In tracing the GC starts from the \"roots\" - things like stack references, and traces all reachable (live) objects. Anything that can't be reached is considered dead. In reference counting each time a reference is modified the object's involved have their count updated. Any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead.\nWith basically all GC implementations there are trade offs but tracing is usually good for high through put (i.e. fast) operation but has longer pause times (larger gaps where the UI or program may freeze up). Reference counting can operate in smaller chunks but will be slower overall. It may mean less freezes but poorer performance overall.\nAdditionally a reference counting GC requires a cycle detector to clean up any objects in a cycle that won't be caught by their reference count alone. Perl 5 didn't have a cycle detector in its GC implementation and could leak memory that was cyclic.\nResearch has also been done to get the best of both worlds (low pause times, high throughput):\nhttp://cs.anu.edu.au/~Steve.Blackburn/pubs/papers/urc-oopsla-2003.pdf\n",

Methods of course are chapters.\n",

Yes it's overly explicit but it's also a little easier to maintain. \nIf we are worried about performance, well then I initialize only what has to be done and place it in the areas it gives the most bang for the buck.\nIn a real time system, I question if I even need the variable or constant at all.\nAnd in C++ I often do next to no initialization in either place and move it into an Init() function. Why? Well, in C++ if you're initializing something that can throw an exception during object construction you open yourself to memory leaks.\n",

In the first example the C# compiler (or is it the CLR?) will construct an empty constructor and initialise the variables as if they were in the constructor.\nIf there is already a constructor then any initialisation \"above\" will be moved into the top of it.\nIn terms of best practice the former is less error prone than the latter as someone could easily add another constructor and forget to chain it.\n",

I'd really recommend you look those over and pick the one that appears the easiest for you, and to most closely fit the way you prefer to work.\nOf them, the most comfortable for me to work with was Wicket, due to the lightweight nature of component building and simplicity of page templating.  That goes doubly so if you are using your own db code instead of Hibernate or some other framework (I was never completely happy with Wicket Hibernate or Spring Integration).\nEcho is great if you don't mind writing all of your layout in Java.  I know that is different now, but I still think that product serves a fairly narrow niche.  They change the development model with every major release as well it seems.\nTapestry is a great product, but it is obviously very different from the others in terms of development model as it is led mainly by one dude.  Howard Lewis Ship is no doubt quite smart, but I am disappointed with their decision to basically forget backwards compatibility with each release.  Again, though, for your needs this may not matter, and I've always found the Tapestry products pleasurable to work against.\nJSF has been out for years, and still feels like something that a Struts guy built to fix all of the problems of Struts.  Without really understanding all of the problems with Struts.  It still has an unfinished feel to it, although the product is obviously very flexible.  I use it and have some fondness for it, with great hopes for its future.  I think the next release (2.0) to be delivered in JEE6 will really bring it into its own, with a new template syntax (similar to Facelets) and a simplified component model (custom components in only 1 file... finally).\nAnd, of course, there are a million smaller frameworks and tools that get their own following (Velocity for basic needs, raw JSPs, Struts, etc).  I generally prefer component oriented frameworks myself, though.  \nIn the end, I'd recommend just taking a look at Tapestry, Wicket, and JSF and just picking the one that feels the best to you.  You'll probably find one that just fits the way you like to work very quickly.\n",

        "UPDATE: Tapestry 5.2 is out, so it's not abandoned, as it previously appeared to be. My experience is with Tapestry 4, not 5, so your mileage may vary. My opinion of Tapestry has changed over the years; I have modified this post to reflect it.\nI can no longer recommend Tapestry as I did previously. Tapestry 5 appears to be a significant improvement, but my main issue with Tapestry is not with platform itself; it's with the people behind it.\nHistorically, every major version update of Tapestry has broken backwards compatibility with extreme prejudice, far more than one might expect. This seems to be due to the incorporation of new coding techniques or technologies that require significant rewrites.\nHoward Lewis Ship (the principal author of Tapestry) is certainly a brilliant developer, but I can't say I care for his management of the Tapestry project. Development of Tapestry 5 began almost immediately after Tapestry 4 shipped. From what I can tell, Ship pretty much devoted himself to that, leaving Tapestry 4 in the hands of other contributors, who I feel are not nearly as capable as Ship. After having made the painful switch from Tapestry 3 to Tapestry 4, I felt that I had been abandoned almost immediately.\nOf course, with the release of Tapestry 5, Tapestry 4 became a legacy product. I wouldn't have a problem with this if the upgrade path wasn't so brutal again. So now our development team is in the rather unenviable position: We could continue to use an essentially abandoned web platform (Tapestry 4), make the heinous upgrade to Tapestry 5, or give up on Tapestry entirely and rewrite our application using another platform. None of these options is very attractive.\nTapestry 5 is supposedly written so as to reduce the likelihood of update breakage from this point forward. A good example is in the page classes: in previous incarnations, page classes descended from a base class provided by Tapestry; incompatible API changes in this class were the cause of a large number of backward compatibility problems. In Tapestry 5, pages are POJOs which are enhanced at runtime with the \"magic Tapestry fairy dust\" via annotations. So as long as the contract for the annotations is maintained, changes to Tapestry won't affect your page classes.\nIf this is right, then writing a new application using Tapestry 5 could turn out well. But personally, I don't feel like putting my hand on the burner again.\n",

There are plenty of cases where small or simple XML text can be safely built by hand.\nJust be aware that creating XML text is harder than it looks. Here's some criteria I would consider:\n\nFirst: how much control do you have on the information that goes into the xml?\n\nThe less control you have on the source data, the more likely you will have trouble, and the more advantageous the library becomes. For example: (a) Can you guarantee that the element names will never have a character that is illegal in a name? (b) How about quotes in an attribute's content? Can they happen, and are you handling them? (c) Does the data ever contain anything that might need to be encoded as an entity (like the less-than which often needs to be output as &lt;); are you doing it correctly?\n\nSecond, maintainability: is the code that builds the XML easy to understand by someone else?\n\nYou probably don't want to be stuck with the code for life. I've worked with second-hand C++ code that hand-builds XML and it can be surprisingly obscure. Of course, if this is a personal project of yours, then you don't need to worry about \"others\": substitute \"in a year\" for \"others\" above.\nI wouldn't worry about performance. If your XML is simple enough that you can hand-write it, any overhead from the library is probably meaningless. Of course, your case might be different, but you should measure to prove it first.\nFinally, Yes; you can hand build XML text by hand if it's simple enough; but not knowing the libraries available is probably not the right reason.\nA modern XML library is a quite powerful tool, but it can also be daunting. However, learning the essentials of your XML library is not that hard, and it can be quite handy; among other things, it's almost a requisite in today's job marketplace.

In this case, the Master Pages functionality is a plugin on top of Struts.\nVelocity is a generic templating engine, not specialized for web pages and definitely more complicated than you need.  (I've seen it used for code generation.)\nTapestry is more of a full featured web stack than Tile, and is probably good for your purposes.  Its templating functionality involves creating a component and putting all common markup in that.  An example is at http://www.infoq.com/articles/tapestry5-intro.\nThe specifics of this differ based on which Java web framework you choose.\n",

This is roughly equivalent to declaring the MasterPageFile attribute in an ASP.NET page.\nInside the <ui:composition/> element, you use <ui:define/> elements to override the template defaults, similar to the way an <asp:Content/> tag is used.  These elements can contain any kind of content - from simple strings to JSF elements.\nSo, to bring it all together...\nIn master.xhtml:\n\nIn page.xhtml:\n\nAnd this will render as:\n\nYou also get some other benefits with Facelets, such as the ability to reuse page components with different data.\n(Edited to provide more information.)\n",

Of course it helps if some thought goes into structuring exceptions from the beginning. But generally, use custom exceptions for all cases that have no 1:1 correspondence to existing, situation-specific exceptions.\nOn the other hand, NullPointerExceptions and IndexOutofBoundsExceptions might actually often be appropriate. Don't catch these, though (except for logging) as they're a programming error which means that after throwing them, the program is in an undefined state.\n",

        "Don't do what the developers at my company did. Somebody created an [sic] InvalidArguementException that parallels java.lang.IllegalArgumentException, and we now use it in (literally) hundreds of classes. Both indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument. Talk about a waste...\nJoshua Bloch covers this in Effective Java Programming Language Guide [my bible of first resort on Best Practices] Chapter 8. Exceptions Item 42: Favor the use of standard exceptions. Here's a bit of what he says,\n\nReusing preexisting exceptions has several benefits. Chief among these, it makes your API easier to learn and use because it matches established conventions with which programmers are already familiar [my emphasis, not Bloch's]. A close second is that programs using your API are easier to read because they aren't cluttered with unfamiliar exceptions. Finally, fewer exception classes mean a smaller memory footprint and less time spent loading classes.\nThe most commonly reused exception is IllegalArgumentException. This is generally the exception to throw when the caller passes in an argument whose value is inappropriate. For example, this would be the exception to throw if the caller passed a negative number in a parameter representing the number of times some action were to be repeated.\n\nThat said, you should never throw Exception itself. Java has a well-chosen, diverse and well-targeted bunch of built-in exceptions that cover most situations AND describe the exception that occurred well enough so that you can remedy the cause.\nBe friendly to the programmers who have to maintain your code in the future.\n",

So these are called Checked\n  exceptions.   But Errors, and Runtime\n  Exceptions are not checked for by\n  compiler (even though you can choose\n  to catch, or declare, it is not\n  required).  So, these two are called\n  Unchecked exceptions.\nErrors are used to represent those\n  conditions which occur outside the\n  application, such as crash of the\n  system.  Runtime exceptions are\n  usually occur by fault in the\n  application logic.  You can't do\n  anything in these situations.  When\n  runtime exception occur, you have to\n  re-write your program code.  So, these\n  are not  checked by compiler.  These\n  runtime exceptions will uncover in\n  development, and testing period.  Then\n  we have to refactor our code to remove\n  these errors.\n\n", 
        "The rule I use is: never use unchecked exceptions! (or when you don't see any way around it)\nFrom the point of view of the developer using your library or the end-user using your library/application it really sucks to be confronted with an application that crashes due to an uncought exception.

Please don't shoot the messenger and refer to those arguments.\n", 
        "Here is my 'final rule of thumb'.\nI use:\n\nunchecked exception within the code of my method for a failure due to the caller (that involves an explicit and complete documentation)\nchecked exception for a failure due to the callee that I need to make explicit to anyone wanting to use my code\n\nCompare to the previous answer, this is a clear rationale (upon which one can agree or disagree) for the use of one or the other (or both) kind of exceptions.\n\nFor both of those exceptions, I will create my own unchecked and checked Exception for my application (a good practice, as mentionned here), except for very common unchecked exception (like NullPointerException)\nSo for instance, the goal of this particular function below is to make (or get if already exist) an object,\nmeaning:\n\nthe container of the object to make/get MUST exist (responsibility of the CALLER\n=> unchecked exception, AND clear javadoc comment for this called function)\nthe other parameters can not be null\n(choice of the coder to put that on the CALLER: the coder will not check for null parameter but the coder DOES DOCUMENT IT)\nthe result CAN NOT BE NULL\n(responsibility and choice of the code of the callee, choice which will be of great interest for the caller\n=> checked exception because every callers MUST take a decision if the object can not be created/found, and that decision must be enforced at the compilation time: they can not use this function without having to deal with this possibility, meaning with this checked exception).  \n\nExample:\n\n\n", 
        "On any large enough system, with many layers, checked exception are useless as, anyway, you need an architectural level strategy to handle how the exception will be handled (use a fault barrier)\nWith checked exceptions your error handling stategy is micro-managed and its unbearable on any large system.\nMost of the time you don't know if an error is \"recoverable\" because you don't know in what layer the caller of your API is located.\nLet's say that I create a StringToInt API that converts the string representation of an integer to an Int. Must I throw a checked exception if the API is called with the \"foo\" string ? Is it recoverable ? I don't know because in his layer the caller of my StringToInt API may already have validated the input, and if this exception is thrown it's either a bug or a data corruption and it isn't recoverable for this layer.\nIn this case the caller of the API does not want to catch the exception. He only wants to let the exception \"bubble up\". If I chose a checked exception, this caller will have plenty of useless catch block only to artificially rethrow the exception.\nWhat is recoverable depends most of the time on the caller of the API, not on the writter of the API.

An example:\n\nAlso remember:\nWhen using a hash-based Collection or Map such as HashSet, LinkedHashSet, HashMap, Hashtable, or WeakHashMap, make sure that the hashCode() of the key objects that you put into the collection never changes while the object is in the collection. The bulletproof way to ensure this is to make your keys immutable, which has also other benefits.\n", 
        "A clarification about the obj.getClass() != getClass().\nThis statement is the result of equals() being inheritance unfriendly. The JLS (Java language specification) specifies that if A.equals(B) == true then B.equals(A) must also return true. If you omit that statement inheriting classes that override equals() (and change its behavior) will break this specification.\nConsider the following example of what happens when the statement is omitted:\n\nDoing new A(1).equals(new A(1)) Also, new B(1,1).equals(new B(1,1)) result give out true, as it should.\nThis looks all very good, but look what happens if we try to use both classes:\n\nObviously, this is wrong.\nIf you want to ensure the symmetric condition. a=b if b=a and the Liskov substitution principle call super.equals(other) not only in the case of B instance, but check after for A instance:\n\nWhich will output:\n\nWhere, if a is not a reference of B, then it might be a be a reference of class A (because you extend it), in this case you call super.equals() too.\n", 
        "There are a couple of ways to do your check for class equality before checking member equality, and I think both are useful in the right circumstances.\n\nUse the instanceof operator.\nUse this.getClass().equals(that.getClass()).\n\nI use #1 in a final equals implementation, or when implementing an interface that prescribes an algorithm for equals (like the java.util collection interfaces\u2014the right way to check with with (obj instanceof Set) or whatever interface you're implementing). It's generally a bad choice when equals can be overridden because that breaks the symmetry property.\nOption #2 allows the class to be safely extended without overriding equals or breaking symmetry.\nIf your class is also Comparable, the equals and compareTo methods should be consistent too. Here's a template for the equals method in a Comparable class:\n\n", 
        "One gotcha I have found is where two objects contain references to each other (one example being a parent/child relationship with a convenience method on the parent to get all children).\nThese sorts of things are fairly common when doing Hibernate mappings for example.\nIf you include both ends of the relationship in your hashCode or equals tests it's possible to get into a recursive loop which ends in a StackOverflowException.\nThe simplest solution is to not include the getChildren collection in the methods.\n",

These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means thatthis.getClass() == o.getClass() will return false. For example:\n\nIf you're dealing with an ORM, using o instanceof Person is the only thing that will behave correctly.\nLazy loaded objects have null-fields\nORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that person.name will be null if person is lazy loaded, even if person.getName() forces loading and returns \"John Doe\". In my experience, this crops up more often in hashCode() and equals().\nIf you're dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in hashCode() and equals().\nSaving an object will change its state\nPersistent objects often use a id field to hold the key of the object. This field will be automatically updated when an object is first saved. Don't use an id field in hashCode(). But you can use it in equals().\nA pattern I often use is\n\nBut: you cannot include getId() in hashCode(). If you do, when an object is persisted, its hashCode changes. If the object is in a HashSet, you'll \"never\" find it again.\nIn my Person example, I probably would use getName() for hashCode and getId() plus getName() (just for paranoia) for equals(). It's okay if there are some risk of \"collisions\" for hashCode(), but never okay for equals().\nhashCode() should use the non-changing subset of properties from equals()\n",

Most of the time your objects don't have these references so they don't need to be called.\nIt's bad to try to collect the garbage because it's not really your garbage. You have told the VM to allocate some memory when you created objects, and the garbage collector is hiding information about those objects. Internally the GC is performing optimisations on the memory allocations it makes. When you manually try to collect the garbage you have no knowledge about what the GC wants to hold onto and get rid of, you are just forcing it's hand. As a result you mess up internal calculations.\nIf you knew more about what the GC was holding internally then you might be able to make more informed decisions, but then you've missed the benefits of GC.\n",

System.gc() is a sledge-hammer.\nJava's heap is divided into different generations, each of which is collected using a different strategy. If you attach a profiler to a healthy app, you'll see that it very rarely has to run the most expensive kinds of collections because most objects are caught by the faster copying collector in the young generation.\nCalling System.gc() directly, while technically not guaranteed to do anything, in practice will trigger an expensive, stop-the-world full heap collection. This is almost always the wrong thing to do. You think you're saving resources, but you're actually wasting them for no good reason, forcing Java to recheck all your live objects \u201cjust in case\u201d.\nIf you are having problems with GC pauses during critical moments, you're better off configuring the JVM to use the concurrent mark/sweep collector, which was designed specifically to minimise time spent paused, than trying to take a sledgehammer to the problem and just breaking it further.\nThe Sun document you were thinking of is here: Java SE 6 HotSpot\u2122 Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning\n(Another thing you might not know: implementing a finalize() method on your object makes garbage collection slower. Firstly, it will take two GC runs to collect the object: one to run finalize() and the next to ensure that the object wasn't resurrected during finalization. Secondly, objects with finalize() methods have to be treated as special cases by the GC because they have to be collected individually, they can't just be thrown away in bulk.)\n",

So an inner class thread keeps a lot more baggage than you might expect.\nIn a very related vein, if you're using serialization, and you've serialized temporary objects, you're going to need to clear the serialization caches, by calling ObjectOutputStream.reset()  or your process will leak memory and eventually die.\nDownside is that non-transient objects are going to get re-serialized.\nSerializing temporary result objects can be a bit more messy than you might think!\nConsider using soft references. If you don't know what soft references are, have a read of the javadoc for java.lang.ref.SoftReference\nSteer clear of Phantom references and Weak references unless you really get excitable.\nFinally, if you really can't tolerate the GC use Realtime Java. \nNo, I'm not joking.\nThe reference implementation is free to download and Peter Dibbles book from SUN is really good reading.\n", 
        "Avoid finalizers.  There is no guarantee that they will be called in a timely fashion.  It could take quite a long time before the Memory Management system (i.e., the garbage collector) decides to collect an object with a finalizer.  \nMany people use finalizers to do things like close socket connections or delete temporary files.  By doing so you make your application behaviour unpredictable and tied to when the JVM is going to GC your object.  This can lead to \"out of memory\" scenarios, not due to the Java Heap being exhausted, but rather due to the system running out of handles for a particular resource.\nOne other thing to keep in mind is that introducing the calls to System.gc() or such hammers may show good results in your environment, but they won't necessarily translate to other systems.  Not everyone runs the same JVM, there are many, SUN, IBM J9, BEA JRockit, Harmony, OpenJDK, etc... This JVM all conform to the JCK (those that have been officially tested that is), but have a lot of freedom when it comes to making things fast.  GC is one of those areas that everyone invests in heavily.  Using a hammer will often times destroy that effort.\n",

This means you generally shouldn't rely on them.\nFinalizers are not guaranteed to be idempotent.  The garbage collector takes great care to guarantee that it will never call finalize() more than once on the same object.  With well-written objects, it won't matter, but with poorly written objects, calling finalize multiple times can cause problems (e.g. double release of a native resource ... crash).\nEvery object that has a finalize() method should also provide a close() (or similar) method.

What I'd like to see is what you all think I just have to cover.  \nRemember, this is an introductory presentation.  Most of the people are experienced Java developers, but I'm pretty sure they have little to no Groovy knowledge.  I won't poison the well by mentioning what I've already got down to cover as I want to see what the community has to offer.\nWhat are the best things I can cover (in a 1 hour time frame) that will help me effectively communicate to these Java developers how useful Groovy could be to them?\np.s. I'll share my presentation here later for anyone interested.\nas promised now that my presentation has been presented here it is\n", 
        "I don't know anything about groovy so in a sense I've qualified to answer this...\nI would want you to:\n\nTell me why I would want to use Scripting (in general) as opposed to Java-- what does it let me do quicker (as in development time), what does it make more readable. Give tantalising examples of ways I can use chunks of scripting in my mostly Java app. You want to make this relevant to Java devs moreso than tech-junkies.\nWith that out of the way, why Groovy? Why not Ruby, Python or whatever (which are all runnable on the JVM).\nDon't show me syntax that Java can already do (if statements, loops etc) or if you do make it quick. It's as boring as hell to watch someone walk through language syntax 101 for 20min.\n\n\nFor syntax that has a comparible feature in Java maybe show them side by side quickly.\nFor syntax that is not in Java (closures etc) you can talk to them in a bit more detail.\n\nRemember those examples from the first point. Show me one, fully working (or at least looking like it is).\nAt the end have question time. That is crazy important, and with that comes a burden on you to be a psuedo-guru :P.\n\nI'm not sure about how the Java6 scripting support works but I'm fairly sure it can be made secure. I remember something about defining the API the script can use before it's run.\nIf this is the case then an example you could show would be some thick-client application (e.g. a music player) where users can write their own scripts with an API you provide them in Groovy which allows them to script their app in interesting and secure ways (e.g. creating custom columns in the playlist)\n",

Build a basic CRUD app.  Explain that tables are being created behind the scenes using GORM(Hibernate).  Then explain that you can create a war file and deploy it as you would any other Java war file. You can also add Grails/Groovy to an existing Java/JSP project so it doesn't require a huge commitment or paradigm change.  \nGroovy/Grails is simply Ruby/Rails for Java people. I'd cover the plugins for Netbeans/Eclipse too.  Groovy/Grails are just now getting full support in the major IDE's.\nFinally, if you can find a good diagram that shows how Grails is built on top of Spring, Hibernate, Quartz, Sitemesh and Groovy, I think people will understand that there is a treasure chest waiting to be unlocked.\n",

        "The log4j network adapter sends events as a serialised java object. I would like to be able to capture this object and deserialise it in a different language (python). Is this possible?\nNOTE The network capturing is easy; its just a TCP socket and reading in a stream. The difficulty is the deserialising part\n", 
        "Generally, no.\nThe stream format for Java serialization is defined in this document, but you need access to the original class definitions (and a Java runtime to load them into) to turn the stream data back into something approaching the original objects. For example, classes may define writeObject() and readObject() methods to customise their own serialized form.\n(edit: lubos hasko suggests having a little java program to deserialize the objects in front of Python, but the problem is that for this to work, your \"little java program\" needs to load the same versions of all the same classes that it might deserialize. Which is tricky if you're receiving log messages from one app, and really tricky if you're multiplexing more than one log stream. Either way, it's not going to be a little program any more. edit2: I could be wrong here, I don't know what gets serialized. If it's just log4j classes you should be fine. On the other hand, it's possible to log arbitrary exceptions, and if they get put in the stream as well my point stands.)\nIt would be much easier to customise the log4j network adapter and replace the raw serialization with some more easily-deserialized form (for example you could use XStream to turn the object into an XML representation)\n", 
        "In theory it's possible. Now how difficult in practice it might be depends on whether Java serialization format is documented or not. I guess, it's not. edit: oops, I was wrong, thanks Charles.\nAnyway, this is what I suggest you to do\n\ncapture from log4j & deserialize Java object in your own little Java program.\nnow when you have the object again, serialize it using your own custom formatter. \nTip: Maybe you don't even have to write your own custom formatter. for example, JSON (scroll down for libs) has libraries for Python and Java, so you could in theory use Java library to serialize your objects and Python equivalent library to deserialize it\nsend output stream to your python application and deserialize it\n\n\nCharles wrote:\nthe problem is that for this\n  to work, your \"little java program\"\n  needs to load the same versions of all\n  the same classes that it might\n  deserialize.

I'm just giving general advice here that is applicable to any pair of languages (name of the question is pretty language agnostic so I just provided one of the generic solutions). Anyway, I'm not familiar with log4j and don't know whether you can \"inject\" your own serializer into it. If you can, then of course your suggestion is much better and cleaner.\n", 
        "I would recommend moving to a third-party format (by creating your own log4j adapters etc) that both languages understand and can easily marshal / unmarshal, e.g. XML.\n", 
        "Theoretically, it's possible. The Java Serialization, like pretty much everything in Javaland, is standardized. So, you could implement a deserializer according to that standard in Python. However, the Java Serialization format is not designed for cross-language use, the serialization format is closely tied to the way objects are represented inside the JVM. While implementing a JVM in Python is surely a fun exercise, it's probably not what you're looking for (-:\nThere are other (data) serialization formats that are specifically designed to be language agnostic. They usually work by stripping the data formats down to the bare minimum (number, string, sequence, dictionary and that's it) and thus requiring a bit of work on both ends to represent a rich object as a graph of dumb data structures (and vice versa).\nTwo examples are JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language).\nASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) is another data serialization format. Instead of dumbing the format down to a point where it can be easily understood, ASN.1 is self-describing, meaning all the information needed to decode a stream is encoded within the stream itself.\nAnd, of course, XML (eXtensible Markup Language), will work too, provided that it is not just used to provide textual representation of a \"memory dump\" of a Java object, but an actual abstract, language-agnostic encoding.\nSo, to make a long story short: your best bet is to either try to coerce log4j into logging in one of the above-mentioned formats, replace log4j with something that does that or try to somehow intercept the objects before they are sent over the wire and convert them before leaving Javaland.\nLibraries that implement JSON, YAML, ASN.1 and XML are available for both Java and Python (and pretty much every programming language known to man).\n", 
        "Well I am not Python expert so I can't comment on how to solve your problem but if you have program in .NET you may use IKVM.NET to deserialize Java objects easily. I have experimented this by creating .NET Client for Log4J log messages written to Socket appender and it worked really well.\nI am sorry, if this answer does not make sense here.\n",

        "The primary reason stateless session beans are single threaded is to make them highly scalable for the container. The container can make a lot of simplifying assumptions about the runtime environment.

Here's a link to some Sun docs on the subject.\n\nGenerics are implemented by type\n  erasure: generic type information is\n  present only at compile time, after\n  which it is erased by the compiler.\n\n", 
        "C++ templates are actually much more powerful than their C# and Java counterparts as they are evaluated at compile time and support specialization. This allows for Template Meta-Programming and makes the C++ compiler equivalent to a Turing machine (i.e. during the compilation process you can compute anything that is computable with a Turing machine).\n", 
        "C++ rarely uses the \u201cgenerics\u201d terminology. Instead, the word \u201ctemplates\u201d is used and is more accurate. Templates describes one technique to achieve a generic design.\nC++ templates is very different from what both C# and Java implement for two main reasons. The first reason is that C++ templates don't only allow compile-time type arguments but also compile-time const-value arguments: templates can be given as integers or even function signatures. This means that you can do some quite funky stuff at compile time, e.g. calculations:\n\nThis code also uses the other distinguished feature of C++ templates, namely template specialization. The code defines one class template, product that has one value argument. It also defines a specialization for that template that is used whenever the argument evaluates to 1. This allows me to define a recursion over template definitions. I believe that this was first discovered by Andrei Alexandrescu.\nTemplate specialization is important for C++ because it allows for structural differences in data structures. Templates as a whole is a means of unifying an interface across types. However, although this is desirable, all types cannot be treated equally inside the implementation. C++ templates takes this into account. This is very much the same difference that OOP makes between interface and implementation with the overriding of virtual methods.\nC++ templates are essential for its algorithmic programming paradigm. For example, almost all algorithms for containers are defined as functions that accept the container type as a template type and treat them uniformly. Actually, that's not quite right: C++ doesn't work on containers but rather on ranges that are defined by two iterators, pointing to the beginning and behind the end of the container. Thus, the whole content is circumscribed by the iterators: begin <= elements < end.\nUsing iterators instead of containers is useful because it allows to operate on parts of a container instead of on the whole.\nAnother distinguishing feature of C++ is the possibility of partial specialization for class templates. This is somewhat related to pattern matching on arguments in Haskell and other functional languages. For example, let's consider a class that stores elements:\n\nThis works for any element type. But let's say that we can store pointers more effciently than other types by applying some special trick. We can do this by partially specializing for all pointer types:\n\nNow, whenever we instance a container template for one type, the appropriate definition is used:\n\n", 
        "In Java, generics are compiler level only, so you get:\n\nNote that the type of 'a' is an array list, not a list of strings. So the type of a list of bananas would equal() a list of monkeys.\nSo to speak.\n", 
        "Follow-up to my previous posting.\nTemplates are one of the main reasons why C++ fails so abysmally at intellisense, regardless of the IDE used. Because of template specialization, the IDE can never be really sure if a given member exists or not. Consider:\n\nNow, the cursor is at the indicated position and it's damn hard for the IDE to say at that point if, and what, members a has. For other languages the parsing would be straightforward but for C++, quite a bit of evaluation is needed beforehand.\nIt gets worse. What if my_int_type were defined inside a class template as well? Now its type would depend on another type argument. And here, even compilers fail.\n\nAfter a bit of thinking, a programmer would conclude that this code is the same as the above: Y<int>::my_type resolves to int, therefore b should be the same type as a, right?\nWrong. At the point where the compiler tries to resolve this statement, it doesn't actually know Y<int>::my_type yet! Therefore, it doesn't know that this is a type. It could be something else, e.g. a member function or a field. This might give rise to ambiguities (though not in the present case), therefore the compiler fails. We have to tell it explicitly that we refer to a type name:\n\nNow, the code compiles. To see how ambiguities arise from this situation, consider the following code:\n\nThis code statement is perfectly valid and tells C++ to execute the function call to Y<int>::my_type. However, if my_type is not a function but rather a type, this statement would still be valid and perform a special cast (the function-style cast) which is often a constructor invocation. The compiler can't tell which we mean so we have to disambiguate here.\n", 
        "Both Java and C# introduced generics after their first language release.  However, there are differences in how the core libraries changed when generics was introduced.  C#'s generics are not just compiler magic and so it was not possible to generify existing library classes without breaking backwards compatibility.\nFor example, in Java the existing Collections Framework was completely genericised.  Java does not have both a generic and legacy non-generic version of the collections classes.  In some ways this is much cleaner - if you need to use a collection in C# there is really very little reason to go with the non-generic version, but those legacy classes remain in place, cluttering up the landscape. \nAnother notable difference is the Enum classes in Java and C#.  Java's Enum has this somewhat tortuous looking definition:\n\n(see Angelika Langer's very clear explanation of exactly why this is so.  Essentially, this means Java can give type safe access from a string to its Enum value:\n\nCompare this to C#'s version:\n\nAs Enum already existed in C# before generics was introduced to the language, the definition could not change without breaking existing code.  So, like collections, it remains in the core libraries in this legacy state.\n", 
        "I'll add my voice to the noise and take a stab at making things clear:\nC# Generics allow you to declare something like this.\n\nand then the compiler will prevent you from putting things that aren't Person into the list.\nBehind the scenes the C# compiler is just putting List<Person> into the .NET dll file, but at runtime the JIT compiler  goes and builds a new set of code, as if you had written a special list class just for containing people - something like ListOfPerson.\nThe benefit of this is that it makes it really fast. There's no casting or any other stuff, and because the dll contains the information that this is a List of Person, other code that looks at it later on using reflection can tell that it contains Person objects (so you get intellisense and so on).\nThe downside of this is that old C# 1.0 and 1.1 code (before they added generics) doesn't understand these new List<something>, so you have to manually convert things back to plain old List to interoperate with them. This is not that big of a problem, because C# 2.0 binary code is not backwards compatible. The only time this will ever happen is if you're upgrading some old C# 1.0/1.1 code to C# 2.0\nJava Generics allow you to declare something like this.\n\nOn the surface it looks the same, and it sort-of is. The compiler will also prevent you from putting things that aren't Person into the list.\nThe difference is what happens behind the scenes. Unlike C#, Java does not go and build a special ListOfPerson - it just uses the plain old ArrayList which has always been in Java. When you get things out of the array, the usual Person p = (Person)foo.get(1); casting-dance still has to be done. The compiler is saving you the key-presses, but the speed hit/casting is still incurred just like it always was.\nWhen people mention \"Type Erasure\" this is what they're talking about. The compiler inserts the casts for you, and then 'erases' the fact that it's meant to be a list of Person not just Object\nThe benefit of this approach is that old code which doesn't understand generics doesn't have to care. It's still dealing with the same old ArrayList as it always has. This is more important in the java world because they wanted to support compiling code using Java 5 with generics, and having it run on old 1.4 or previous JVM's, which microsoft deliberately decided not to bother with.\nThe downside is the speed hit I mentioned previously, and also because there is no ListOfPerson pseudo-class or anything like that going into the .class files, code that looks at it later on (with reflection, or if you pull it out of another collection where it's been converted into Object or so on) can't tell in any way that it's meant to be a list containing only Person and not just any other array list.\nC++ Templates allow you to declare something like this\n\nIt looks like C# and Java generics, and it will do what you think it should do, but behind the scenes different things are happening.\nIt has the most in common with C# generics in that it builds special pseudo-classes rather than just throwing the type information away like java does, but it's a whole different kettle of fish.\nBoth C# and Java produce output which is designed for virtual machines. If you write some code which has a Person class in it, in both cases some information about a Person class will go into the .dll or .class file, and the JVM/CLR will do stuff with this.\nC++ produces raw x86 binary code. Everything is not an object, and there's no underlying virtual machine which needs to know about a Person class. There's no boxing or unboxing, and functions don't have to belong to classes, or indeed anything. \nBecause of this, the C++ compiler places no restrictions on what you can do with templates - basically any code you could write manually, you can get templates to write for you.\nThe most obvious example is adding things:\nIn C# and Java, the generics system needs to know what methods are available for a class, and it needs to pass this down to the virtual machine. The only way to tell it this is by either hard-coding the actual class in, or using interfaces. For example:\n\nThat code won't compile in C# or Java, because it doesn't know that the type T actually provides a method called Name(). You have to tell it - in C# like this:\n\nAnd then you have to make sure the things you pass to addNames implement the IHasName interface and so on. The java syntax is different (<T extends IHasName>), but it suffers from the same problems.\nThe 'classic' case for this problem is trying to write a function which does this\n\nYou can't actually write this code because there are no ways to declare an interface with the + method in it. You fail.\nC++ suffers from none of these problems. The compiler doesn't care about passing types down to any VM's - if both your objects have a .Name() function, it will compile. If they don't, it won't. Simple.\nSo, there you have it :-)\n", 
        "There are already a lot of good answers on what the differences are, so let me give a slightly different perspective and add the why.\nAs was already explained, the main difference is type erasure, i.e. the fact that the Java compiler erases the generic types and they don't end up in the generated bytecode. However, the question is: why would anyone do that? It doesn't make sense! Or does it?\nWell, what's the alternative? If you don't implement generics in the language, where do you implement them? And the answer is: in the Virtual Machine. Which breaks backwards compatibility.\nType erasure, on the other hand, allows you to mix generic clients with non-generic libraries. In other words: code that was compiled on Java 5 can still be deployed to Java 1.4.\nMicrosoft, however, decided to break backwards compatibility for generics. That's why .NET Generics are \"better\" than Java Generics.\nOf course, Sun aren't idiots or cowards. The reason why they \"chickened out\", was that Java was significantly older and more widespread than .NET when they introduced generics. (They were introduced roughly at the same time in both worlds.) Breaking backwards compatibility would have been a huge pain.\nPut yet another way: in Java, Generics are a part of the Language (which means they apply only to Java, not to other languages), in .NET they are part of the Virtual Machine (which means they apply to all languages, not just C# and Visual Basic.NET).\nCompare this with .NET features like LINQ, lambda expressions, local variable type inference, anonymous types and expression trees: these are all language features. That's why there are subtle differences between VB.NET and C#: if those features were part of the VM, they would be the same in all languages. But the CLR hasn't changed: it's still the same in .NET 3.5 SP1 as it was in .NET 2.0. You can compile a C# program that uses LINQ with the .NET 3.5 compiler and still run it on .NET 2.0, provided that you don't use any .NET 3.5 libraries. That would not work with generics and .NET 1.1, but it would work with Java and Java 1.4.\n", 
        "Looks like, among other very interesting proposals, there is one about refining generics and breaking backwards compatibility:\n\nCurrently, generics are implemented\n  using erasure, which means that the\n  generic type information is not\n  available at runtime, which makes some\n  kind of code hard to write. Generics\n  were implemented this way to support\n  backwards compatibility with older\n  non-generic code.

Make sure you have some kind of a \"catch all\" exception handling to prevent the software to halt abruptly. That's the most important part of your user experience.\n",

Ultimately, the asserts are going to end up giving a similar experience to the end user but provide no way for the developer calling your code to handle the situation before showing an exception to the end user.

The project as a whole needs to decide on an assertion policy: if the choice is to enable assertions during all development, then I'd say to use assertions to check this kind of invalid parameter - in a production system, a NullPointerException thrown due to a programming error is unlikely to be able to be caught and handled in a meaningful way anyway and so will act just like an assertion.\nPractically though, I know a lot of developers that don't trust that assertions will be enabled when appropriate and so opt for the safety of throwing a NullPointerException.\nOf course if you can't enforce a policy for your code (if you're creating a library, for example, and so are dependent on how other developers run your code), you should opt for the safe approach of throwing NullPointerException for those methods that are part of the library's API.\n",

For example, if you find out that your class would be useful from a web app, or some kind of message consuming app, it would be nice to allow those containers the opportunity to deal with the failure somehow. A container may want to retry the operation, decide to log and ignore the problem, send an email to an administrator, etc.\nAn exception to this would be your main() method; this could trap the Exception, and call System.exit() with some value that can be recognized by the calling process or shell script.\n", 
        "The use of System.exit is frowned upon when the 'application' is really a sub-application (e.g. servlet, applet) of a larger Java application (server): in this case the System.exit could stop the JVM and hence also all other sub-applications. In this situation, throwing an appropriate exception, which could be caught and handled by the application framework/server is the best option.\nIf the java application is really meant to be run as a standalone application, there is nothing wrong with using System.exit. in this case, setting an exit value is probably the easiest (and also most used) way of communicating failure or success to the parent process.\n", 
        "I think throwing an exception is what you should do when something goes wrong. This way, if your application is not running as a stand-alone app the caller can react to it and has some information about what went wrong. It is also easier for debugging purposes because you as well get a better idea about what went wrong when you see a stack trace.\nOne important thing to note is that when the exception reaches the top level and therefore causes the VM to quit the VM returns a return code of 1, therefore outside applications that use the return code see that something went wrong.\nThe only case where I think System.exit() makes sense is when your app is meant to be called by applications which are not Java and therefore have to use return codes to see if your app worked or not and you want those applications to have a chance to react differently on different things going wrong, i.e. you need different return codes.\n",

For the purposes of these questions, you can assume that all of the custom controls are using valuebindings/expressions (not literal bindings).  Although I'll gladly upvote those who give good explanations on that as well, since that could be helpful for others (and me down the line).\n\nWhere do I set the value for the valuebinding?  Is this supposed to happen in decode?  Or should decode do something else and then have the value set in encodeBegin?\nRead from the Value Binding - When do I read data from the valuebinding vs. reading it from submittedvalue and putting it into the valuebinding?  \nWhen are action listeners on forms called in relation to all of this?  The JSF lifecycle pages all mention events happening at various steps, but its not completely clear to me when just a simple listener for a commandbutton is being called\n\nI've tried a few combinations, but always end up with hard to find bugs that I believe are coming from basic misunderstandings of the event lifecycle.\n",

        "There is a pretty good diagram in the JSF specification that shows the request lifecycle - essential for understanding this stuff.\nThe steps are:\n\nRestore View. The UIComponent tree is rebuilt.\nApply Request Values. Editable components should implement EditableValueHolder. This phase walks the component tree and calls the processDecodes methods. If the component isn't something complex like a UIData, it won't do much except call its own decode method. The decode method doesn't do much except find its renderer and invokes its decode method, passing itself as an argument. It is the renderer's job to get any submitted value and set it via setSubmittedValue.\nProcess Validations. This phase calls processValidators which will call validate. The validate method takes the submitted value, converts it with any converters, validates it with any validators and (assuming the data passes those tests) calls setValue. This will store the value as a local variable. While this local variable is not null, it will be returned and not the value from the value binding for any calls to getValue.\nUpdate Model Values. This phase calls processUpdates. In an input component, this will call updateModel which will get the ValueExpression and invoke it to set the value on the model.\nInvoke Application. Button event listeners and so on will be invoked here (as will navigation if memory serves).\nRender Response. The tree is rendered via the renderers and the state saved.\nIf any of these phases fail (e.g. a value is invalid), the lifecycle skips to Render Response.\nVarious events can be fired after most of these phases, invoking listeners as appropriate (like value change listeners after Process Validations).\n\nThis is a somewhat simplified version of events. Refer to the specification for more details.\nI would question why you are writing your own UIComponent. This is a non-trivial task and a deep understanding of the JSF architecture is required to get it right.

        "Unchecked exceptions are alright if you want to handle every failure the same way, for example by logging it and skipping to the next request, displaying a message to the user and handling the next event, etc. If this is my use case, all I have to do is catch some general exception type at a high level in my system, and handle everything the same way.\nBut I want to recover from specific problems, and I'm not sure the best way to approach it with unchecked exceptions. Here is a concrete example.\nSuppose I have a web application, built using Struts2 and Hibernate. If an exception bubbles up to my \"action\", I log it, and display a pretty apology to the user. But one of the functions of my web application is creating new user accounts, that require a unique user name. If a user picks a name that already exists, Hibernate throws an org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException (an unchecked exception) down in the guts of my system. I'd really like to recover from this particular problem by asking the user to choose another user name, rather than giving them the same \"we logged your problem but for now you're hosed\" message.\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\nThere a lot of people creating accounts simultaneously. I don't want to lock the whole user table between a \"SELECT\" to see if the name exists and an \"INSERT\" if it doesn't. In the case of relational databases, there might be some tricks to work around this, but what I'm really interested in is the general case where pre-checking for an exception won't work because of a fundamental race condition. Same thing could apply to looking for a file on the file system, etc.\nGiven my CTO's propensity for drive-by management induced by reading technology columns in \"Inc.\", I need a layer of indirection around the persistence mechanism so that I can throw out Hibernate and use Kodo, or whatever, without changing anything except the lowest layer of persistence code. As a matter of fact, there are several such layers of abstraction in my system. How can I prevent them from leaking in spite of unchecked exceptions?\nOne of the declaimed weaknesses of checked exceptions is having to \"handle\" them in every call on the stack\u2014either by declaring that a calling method throws them, or by catching them and handling them. Handling them often means wrapping them in another checked exception of a type appropriate to the level of abstraction. So, for example, in checked-exception land, a file-system\u2013based implementation of my UserRegistry might catch IOException, while a database implementation would catch SQLException, but both would throw a UserNotFoundException that hides the underlying implementation. How do I take advantage of unchecked exceptions, sparing myself of the burden of this wrapping at each layer, without leaking implementation details?\n\n", 
        "I like to repackage exceptions between the \"tiers\" of my application, so for example a DB-specific exception is repackaged inside of another exception which is meaningful in the context of my application (of course, I leave the original exception as a member so I don't clobber the stack trace).\nThat said, I think that a non-unique user name is not an \"exceptional\" enough situation to warrant a throw.  I'd use a boolean return argument instead.  Without knowing much about your architecture, it's hard for me to say anything more specific or applicable.\n", 
        "Since you're currently using hibernate the easiest thing to do is just check for that exception and wrap it in either a custom exception or in a custom result object you may have setup in your framework.  If you want to ditch hibernate later just make sure you wrap this exception in only 1 place, the first place you catch the exception from hibernate, that's the code you'll probably have to change when you make a switch anyway, so if the catch is in one place then the additional overhead is almost zilch.\nhelp?\n", 
        "I agree with Nick. Exception you described is not really \"unexpected exception\" so you should design you code accordingly taking possible exceptions into account.\nAlso I would recommend to take a look at documentation of Microsoft Enterprise Library Exception Handling Block it has a nice outline of error handling patterns.\n", 
        "IMO, wrapping exceptions (checked or otherwise) has several benefits that are worth the cost:\n1) It encourages you to think about the failure modes for the code you write. Basically, you have to consider the exceptions that the code you call may throw, and in turn you'll consider the exceptions you'll throw for the code that calls yours.\n2) It gives you the opportunity to add additional debugging information into the exception chain. For instance, if you have a method that throws an exception on a duplicate username, you might wrap that exception with one that includes additional information about the circumstances of the failure (for example, the IP of the request that provided the dupe username) that wasn't available to the lower-level code. The cookie trail of exceptions may help you debug a complex problem (it certainly has for me).\n3) It lets you become implementation-independent from the lower level code. If you're wrapping exceptions and need to swap out Hibernate for some other ORM, you only have to change your Hibernate-handling code. All the other layers of code will still be successfully using the wrapped exceptions and will interpret them in the same way, even though the underlying circumstances have changed. Note that this applies even if Hibernate changes in some way (ex: they switch exceptions in a new version); it's not just for wholesale technology replacement.\n4) It encourages you use different classes of exceptions to represent different situations. For example, you may have a DuplicateUsernameException when the user tries to reuse a username, and a DatabaseFailureException when you can't check for dupe usernames due to a broken DB connection. This, in turn, lets you answer your question (\"how do I recover?\") in flexible and powerful ways. If you get a DuplicateUsernameException, you may decide to suggest a different username to the user. If you get a DatabaseFailureException, you may let it bubble up to the point where it displays a \"down for maintenance\" page to the user and send off a notification email to you. Once you have custom exceptions, you have customizeable responses -- and that's a good thing.\n", 
        "You can catch unchecked exceptions without needing to wrap them. For example, the following is valid Java.\n\nSo in your action/controller you can have a try-catch block around the logic where the Hibernate call is made. Depending on the exception you can render specific error messages. \nBut I guess in your today it could be Hibernate, and tomorrow SleepLongerDuringWinter framework.

        "\nThe question is not really related to checked vs. unchecked debate, the same applies to both exception types.\nBetween the point where the ConstraintViolationException is thrown and the point, where we want to handle the violation by displaying a nice error message is a large number of method calls on the stack that should abort immediately and shouldn't care about the problem. That makes the exception mechanism the right choice as opposed to redesigning the code from exceptions to return values.\nIn fact, using an unchecked exception instead of a checked exception is a natural fit, since we really want all intermediate methods on the call stack to ignore the exception and not handle it .\nIf we want to handle the \"unique name violation\" only by displaying a nice error message (error page) to the user, there's not really a need for a specific DuplicateUsernameException. This will keep the number of exception classes low. Instead, we can create a MessageException that can be reused in many similar scenarios.\nAs soon as possible we catch the ConstraintViolationException and convert it to a MessageException with a nice message. It's important to convert it soon, when we can be sure, it's really the \"unique user name constraint\" that was violated and not some other constraint.\nSomewhere close to the top level handler, just handle the MessageException in a different way. Instead of \"we logged your problem but for now you're hosed\" simply display the message contained in the MessageException, no stack trace.\nThe MessageException can take some additional constructor parameters, such as a detailed explanation of the problem, available next action (cancel, go to a different page), icon (error, warning)...\n\nThe code may look like this\n\nIn a totally different place there's a top exception handler\n\n", 
        "@Jan Checked versus unchecked is a central issue here. I question your supposition (#3) that the exception should be ignored in intervening frames. If I do that, I will end up with an implementation-specific dependency in my high-level code. If I replace Hibernate, catch blocks throughout my application will have to be modified. Yet, at the same time, if I catch the exception at a lower level, I'm not receiving much benefit from using an unchecked exception.\nAlso, the scenario here is that I want to catch a specific logical error and change the flow of the application by re-prompting the user for a different ID. Simply changing the displayed message is not good enough, and the ability to map to different messages based on exception type is built into Servlets already.\n",

        "If you have somewhat of a legacy application, and you're not allowed to change the visibility of your methods, the best way to test private methods is to use reflection. \nInternally we're using helpers to get/set private and private static variables as well as invoke private and private static methods.

However, if you're looking for an alternative to using reflection, and have access to the source you're testing, this will still be an option.\nThere is possible merit in testing private methods of a class, particularly with test-driven development, where you would like to design small tests before you write any code.\nCreating a test with access to private members and methods can test areas of code which are difficult to target specifically with access only to public methods. If a public method has several steps involved, it can consist of several private methods, which can then be tested individually.\nAdvantages:\n\nCan test to a finer granularity\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nTest code must reside in the same\nfile as source code, which can be\nmore difficult to maintain\nSimilarly with .class output files, they must remain within the same package as declared in source code\n\nHowever, if continuous testing requires this method, it may be a signal that the private methods should be extracted, which could be tested in the traditional, public way.\nHere is a convoluted example of how this would work:\n\nThe inner class would be compiled to ClassToTest$StaticInnerTest.\nSee also: Java Tip 106: Static inner classes for fun and profit\n",

This doesn't have to change the public interface of the original class; it can internally create an instance of the helper class and call the helper method.\nIf you want to test difficult error conditions coming from the helper method, you can go a step further. Extract an interface from the helper class, add a public getter and setter to the original class to inject the helper class (used through its interface), and then inject a mock version of the helper class into the original class to test how the original class responds to exceptions from the helper. This approach is also helpful if you want to test the original class without also testing the helper class.\n",

Often, this method and the fields it interacts with, and maybe another method or two can be extracted in to a new class.  \nThe new class exposes these methods as 'public', so they're accessible for unit testing.  The new and old classes are now both simpler than the original class, which is great for me (I need to keep things simple, or I get lost!).\nNote that I'm not suggesting that people create classes without using their brain!

Are they that complex, providing such complicated behaviors as to require testing apart from the public surface? It's unit testing, not 'line-of-code' testing. Don't sweat the small stuff.\nIf they are that big, big enough that these private members are each a 'unit' large in complexity -- consider refactoring such private members out of this class.\nIf refactoring is inappropriate or infeasible, can you use the strategy pattern to replace access to these private member functions / member classes when under unit test? Under unit test, the strategy would provide added validation, but in release builds it would be simple passthrough.\n",

However, we are using our own annotations so as not to expose our persistence choice to the business domain experts. \nFor row based security this means we could add an annotation such as @Secured at the entity level, which would cause an extra column to be added to the underlying table to constrain our selects?\nFor column based security, we could perhaps have @Secured to either assist in query generation, or perhaps use an aspect to filter the information returned?\nI'm curious to know how this might affect hibernate's caching mechanisms as well?\nI'm sure a lot of others will have had the same issue, and I was wondering how you approached this?\nMuch appreciated...\n",

Oracle, for example, has the Virtual Private Database (VPD) which will rewrite your queries at the database level.  This solution has the added benefit that any external program (e.g. reporting tools) that goes against your db will have your security restrictions enforced.  VPD also has support to mask restricted columns with NULLs.\nUnfortunately, the above solutions have not been adequate to support the security requirements for the types projects I typically work on.  There is usually some sort of context that cannot be easily expressed in the above solutions.  For example, users can view data that they have created, or that have been been marked as public, or belong to a project which they manage.\nWe typically create query/finder/DAO objects where we pass in the values required to enforce the security and then create the query accordingly.\nI hope this helps\n",

If you create a new class you might not see all possible actions. It's like defensive programming - someday getters and setters may be helpful, and it doesn't cost a lot to create/use them. So they are sometimes useful.\nIn practice, most fields have simple getters and setters.

It's generally good practice to hide data types within the class and expose only the methods that are part of the class API.

        "Re: aku, izb, John Topley...\nWatch out for mutability issues...\nIt may seem sensible to omit getters/setters. It actually may be ok in some cases. The real problem with the proposed pattern shown here is mutability.\nThe problem is once you pass an object reference out containing non-final, public fields. Anything else with that reference is free to modify those fields. You no longer have any control over the state of that object. (Think what would happen if Strings were mutable.)\nIt gets bad when that object is an important part of the internal state of another, you've just exposed internal implementation. To prevent this, a copy of the object must be returned instead. This works, but can cause massive GC pressure from tons of single-use copies created.\nIf you have public fields, consider making the class read-only. Add the fields as parameters to the constructor, and mark the fields final. Otherwise make sure you're not exposing internal state, and if you need to construct new instances for a return value, make sure it won't be called excessively.\nSee: \"Effective Java\" by Joshua Bloch -- Item #13: Favor Immutability.\nPS: Also keep in mind, all JVMs these days will optimize away the getMethod if possible, resulting in just a single field-read instruction. \n",

So, from an API evolution point of view, it's usually a good idea to bite the bullet and use getters/setters.\nOne place where I go the other way is when you strongly control access to the class, for example in an inner static class used as an internal data structure.  In this case, it might be much clearer to use field access.\nBy the way, on e-bartek's assertion, it is highly unlikely IMO that property support will be added in Java 7.  \n",

In general, the more frequently you can make objects in your public API immutable the better, and it is not possible to construct your 'struct-like' object in an immutable fashion.\nAs an aside, even if I were writing this object as a private inner class I would still provide a constructor to simplify the code to initialize the object. Having to have 3 lines of code to get a usable object when one will do is just messy.\n",

        "In C++ when a virtual function is called from within a constructor it doesn't behave like a virtual function. I think everyone who encountered for the first time was surprised but on second thought it makes sense, if the derived constructor hasn't yet run the object is not yet a derived so how can a derived function be called? The preconditions haven't had the chance to be set up. Example:\n\nIt's exactly the same for Java and .NET yet they chose to go the other way, was the only reason the principle of least surprise? \nWhich do you think is the correct choice?\n",

Your best bet is to not call a virtual function in your constructor at all. \nThe C++ way I think makes more sense, but leads to expectation problems when someone reviews your code.

        "I think C++ offers the best semantics in terms of having the 'most correct' behavior ... however it is more work for the compiler and the code is definitiely non-intuitive to someone reading it later.\nWith the .NET approach the function must be very limited not to rely on any derived object state.\n", 
        "\nVirtual functions in constructors, why do languages differ?\n\nBecause there's no one good behaviour.  I find the C++ behaviour makes more sense (since base class c-tors are called first, it stands to reason that they should call base class virtual functions--after all, the derived class c-tor hasn't run yet, so it may not have set up the right preconditions for the derived class virtual function).\nBut sometimes, where I want to use the virtual functions to initialize state (so it doesn't matter that they're being called with the state uninitialized) the C#/Java behaviour is nicer.\n", 
        "Delphi makes good use of virtual constructors in the VCL GUI framework: \n\n", 
        "There's a fundamental difference in how the languages define an object's life time. In Java and .Net the object members are zero/null initialized before any constructor is run and is at this point that the object life time begins. So when you enter the constructor you've already got an initialized object.\nIn C++ the object life time only begins when the constructor finishes (although member variables and base classes are fully constructed before it starts). This explains the behaviour when virtual functions are called and also why the destructor isn't run if there's an exception in the constructor's body.\nThe problem with the Java/.Net definition of object lifetime is that it's harder to make sure the object always meets its invariant without having to put in special cases for when the object is initialized but the constructor hasn't run. The problem with the C++ definition is that you have this odd period where the object is in limbo and not fully constructed.\n", 
        "I have found the C++ behavior very annoying. You cannot write virtual functions to, for instance, return the desired size of the object, and have the default constructor initialize each item. For instance it would be nice to do:\nBaseClass() {\n   for (int i=0; i<virtualSize(); i++)\n     initialize_stuff_for_index(i);\n}\nThen again the advantage of C++ behavior is that it discourages constuctors like the above from being written.\nI don't think the problem of calling methods that assume the constructor has been finished is a good excuse for C++. If this really was a problem then the constructor would not be allowed to call any methods, since the same problem can apply to methods for the base class.\nAnother point against C++ is that the behavior is much less efficient. Although the constructor knows directly what it calls, the vtab pointer has to be changed for every single class from base to final, because the constructor might call other methods that will call virtual functions. From my experience this wastes far more time than is saved by making virtual functions calls in the constructor more efficient.\nFar more annoying is that this is also true of destructors. If you write a virtual cleanup() function, and the base class destructor does cleanup(), it certainly does not do what you expect.\nThis and the fact that C++ calls destructors on static objects on exit have really pissed me off for a long time.\n",

        "The short answer is, you're not missing anything.  The Android SDK doesn't provide a direct method to change the indicator of a TabHost after it's been created.  The TabSpec is only used to build the tab, so changing the TabSpec after the fact will have no effect.\nI think there's a workaround, though.  Call mTabs.getTabWidget() to get a TabWidget object.  This is just a subclass of ViewGroup, so you can call getChildCount() and getChildAt() to access individual tabs within the TabWidget.  Each of these tabs is also a View, and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label, it's almost certainly some other ViewGroup (maybe a LinearLayout, but it doesn't matter) that contains an ImageView and a TextView.  So with a little fiddling with the debugger or Log.i, you should be able to figure out a recipe to get the ImageView and change it directly.\nThe downside is that if you're not careful, the exact layout of the controls within a tab could change and your app could break.  Your initial solution is perhaps more robust, but then again it might lead to other unwanted side effects like flicker or focus problems.\n", 
        "If one Googles for \"difference between notify() and notifyAll()\" then a lot of explanations will pop up (leaving apart the javadoc paragraphs).

If 5 work objects are available at once and you have 5 consumer objects, it would make sense to wake up all threads using notifyAll() so each one can process 1 work object.\nIf you have just one work object available, what is the point in waking up all consumer objects to race for that one object? The first one checking for available work will get it and all other threads will check and find they have nothing to do.\nI found a great explanation here. In short: \n\nThe notify() method is generally used\n  for resource pools, where there\n  are an arbitrary number of \"consumers\"\n  or \"workers\" that take resources, but\n  when a resource is added to the pool,\n  only one of the waiting consumers or\n  workers can deal with it. The\n  notifyAll() method is actually used in\n  most other cases. Strictly, it is\n  required to notify waiters of a\n  condition that could allow multiple\n  waiters to proceed. But this is often\n  difficult to know. So as a general\n  rule, if you have no particular\n  logic for using notify(), then you\n  should probably use notifyAll(),\n  because it is often difficult to know\n  exactly what threads will be waiting\n  on a particular object and why.\n\n", 
        "Simply put, it depends on why your threads are waiting to be notified. Do you want to tell one of the waiting threads that something happened, or do you want to tell all of them at the same time?\nIn some cases, all waiting threads can take useful action once the wait finishes. An example would be a set of threads waiting for a certain task to finish; once the task has finished, all waiting threads can continue with their business. In such a case you would use notifyAll() to wake up all waiting threads at the same time.\nAnother case, for example mutually exclusive locking, only one of the waiting threads can do something useful after being notified (in this case acquire the lock). In such a case, you would rather use notify(). Properly implemented, you could use notifyAll() in this situation as well, but you would unnecessarily wake threads that can't do anything anyway.\n", 
        "Useful differences:\n\nUse notify() if all your waiting threads are interchangeable (the order they wake up doesn't matter), or if you only ever have one waiting thread. A common example is a thread pool used to execute jobs from a queue--when a job is added, one of threads is notified to wake up, execute the next job and go back to sleep.\nUse notifyAll() for other cases where the waiting threads may have different purposes and should be able to run concurrently. An example is a maintenance operation on a shared resource, where multiple threads are waiting for the operation to complete before accessing the resource.\n\n",

The current 'model' implementation is hard to use and is frankly quite ugly (not to mention the UI-code which is truly horrible atm).\nToday I have the Tracks interface which I can use to get instances of Track classes based on their id.

I don't know how to do this in java sorry.\nNote:\nThis applies at the entire process level. If you set affinity for CPU0 only, and then launch 50 threads, all 50 of those threads will run on CPU0, and CPU1, 2, 3, etc will sit around doing nothing.\nJust to reiterate the point, this is primarily useful for troubleshooting broken legacy software. If your software is not broken, you really shouldn't mess with any of these settings, and let windows decide the best CPU(s) to run your program on, so it can take the rest of the system's performance into account.\n\nAs for the 'shared memory' model, it works the same, but there are more things that can go subtly wrong when your app is running on multiple CPU's as opposed to just timeslices on a single one.\nFor an eye-opening example, read this ridiculousfish article about CPU's and Memory Barriers.\nIt's aimed at OSX development on PowerPC, but general enough that it should apply everywhere. IMHO it's one of the top ten 'all developers should read this' articles I've read.\n",

Changing any object's structure breaks the serialized instances of it.  So I'm locked in to what seems to be a horrible versioning nightmare.\nXML Serialization: It's not as brittle, but it's significantly slower that straight out serialization.  It can be transformed outside of my program.  \nJavaDB: I'd considered this since I'm comfortable writing JDBC applications. The difference here is that the database instance would only persist while the file was being opened or saved.  It's not pretty but... it does lend itself to migrating to a central server architecture if the need arises later and it introduces the possibility of quering the datamodel in a simpler way.\n\nI'm curious to see what other people think.

        "I am writing a client-side Swing application (graphical font designer) on Java 5. Recently, I am running into java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error because I am not being conservative on memory usage. The user can open unlimited number of files, and the program keeps the opened objects in the memory. After a quick research I found Ergonomics in the 5.0 Java Virtual Machine and others saying on Windows machine the JVM defaults max heap size as 64MB.\nGiven this situation, how should I deal with this constraint?\nI could increase the max heap size using command line option to java, but that would require figuring out available RAM and writing some launching program or script. Besides, increasing to some finite max does not ultimately get rid of the issue.\nI could rewrite some of my code to persist objects to file system frequently (using database is the same thing) to free up the memory. It could work, but it's probably a lot work too.\nIf you could point me to details of above ideas or some alternatives like automatic virtual memory, extending heap size dynamically, that will be great.\n", 
        "Ultimately you always have a finite max of heap to use no matter what platform you are running on. In Windows 32 bit this is around 2gb (not specifically heap but total amount of memory per process). It just happens that Java chooses to make the default smaller (presumably so that the programmer can't create programs that have runaway memory allocation without running into this problem and having to examine exactly what they are doing).\nSo this given there are several approaches you could take to either determine what amount of memory you need or to reduce the amount of memory you are using. One common mistake with garbage collected languages such as Java or C# is to keep around references to objects that you no longer are using, or allocating many objects when you could reuse them instead. As long as objects have a reference to them they will continue to use heap space as the garbage collector will not delete them.\nIn this case you can use a Java memory profiler to determine what methods in your program are allocating large number of objects and then determine if there is a way to make sure they are no longer referenced, or to not allocate them in the first place. One option which I have used in the past is \"JMP\" http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/.\nIf you determine that you are allocating these objects for a reason and you need to keep around references (depending on what you are doing this might be the case), you will just need to increase the max heap size when you start the program. However, once you do the memory profiling and understand how your objects are getting allocated you should have a better idea about how much memory you need. \nIn general if you can't guarantee that your program will run in some finite amount of memory (perhaps depending on input size) you will always run into this problem. Only after exhausting all of this will you need to look into caching objects out to disk etc. At this point you should have a very good reason to say \"I need Xgb of memory\" for something and you can't work around it by improving your algorithms or memory allocation patterns. Generally this will only usually be the case for algorithms operating on large datasets (like a database or some scientific analysis program) and then techniques like caching and memory mapped IO become useful.\n",

        "If you need to monitor your memory usage at runtime, the java.lang.management package offers MBeans that can be used to monitor the memory pools in your VM (eg, eden space, tenured generation etc), and also garbage collection behaviour.\nThe free heap space reported by these MBeans will vary greatly depending on GC behaviour, particularly if your application generates a lot of objects which are later GC-ed. One possible approach is to monitor the free heap space after each full-GC, which you may be able to use to make a decision on freeing up memory by persisting objects.\nUltimately, your best bet is to limit your memory retention as far as possible whilst performance remains acceptable. As a previous comment noted, memory is always limited, but your app should have a strategy for dealing with memory exhaustion. \n",

        "What is reflection, and why is it useful?\nI'm particularly interested in Java, but I assume the principles are the same in any language.\n", 
        "The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).\nFor example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething' and then call it if you want to.\nSo, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) :\n\nOne very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the @Test annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.\nThere are some good reflection examples to get you started at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html\nAnd finally, yes, the concepts are pretty much similar in other statically types languages which support reflection (like C#). In dynamically typed languages, the use case described above is less necessary (since the compiler will allow any method to be called on any object, failing at runtime if it does not exist), but the second case of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.\n", 
        "Reflection is a set of functions which allows you to access the runtime information of your program and modify it behavior (with some limitations).\nIt's useful because it allows you to change the runtime behaivour depending on the meta information of your program, that is, you can check the return type of a function and change the way you handle the situation.\nIn C# for example you can load an assembly (a .dll) in runtime an examine it, navigating through the classes and taking actions according to what you found. It also let you create an instance of a class on runtime, invoke its method, etc.\nWhere can it be useful? Is not useful everytime but for concrete situations. For example you can use it to get the name of the class for loggin purposes, to dinamically create handlers for events according to what's specified on a configuration file and so on...\n", 
        "Not every language supports reflection but the principles are usually the same in languages that support it.\nReflection is the ability to \"reflect\" on the structure of your program. Or more concrete. To look at the objects and classes you have and programmatically get back information on the methods, fields, and interfaces they implement. You can also look at things like annotations.\nIt's usefull in a lot of situations. Everywhere you want to be able to dynamically plug in classes into your code. Lot's of object relational mappers use reflection to be able to instantiate objects from databases without knowing in advance what objects they're going to use. Plug-in architectures is another place where reflection is usefull. Being able to dynamically load code and determine if there are types there that implement the right interface to use as a plugin is important in those situations.\n", 
        "\nReflection is a language's ability to inspect and dynamically call classes, methods, attributes, etc. at runtime.\n\nFor example, all objects in Java have the method getClass(), which lets you determine the object's class even if you don't know it at compile time (e.g. if you declared it as an Object) - this might seem trivial, but such reflection is not possible in less dynamic languages such as C++. More advanced uses lets you list and call methods, constructors, etc.\nReflection is important since it lets you write programs that do not have to \"know\" everything at compile time, making them more dynamic, since they can be tied together at runtime. The code can be written against known interfaces, but the actual classes to be used can be instantiated using reflection from configuration files.\nLots of modern frameworks use reflection extensively for this very reason. Most other modern languages use reflection as well, and in scripting languages (such as Python) they are even more tightly integrated, since it feels more natural within the general programming model of those languages.\n", 
        "Reflection is a key mechanism to allow an application or framework to work with code that might not have even been written yet!\nTake for example your typical web.xml file.

The servlet container will process the web.xml file, and create new a new instance of each servlet class through reflection.\nAnother example would be the Java API for XML Parsing (JAXP).

When you first get the connection you can add/change headers and other connection properties before actually opening it.\nURLConnection's life cycle is a bit odd.  It doesn't send the headers to the server until you've gotten one of the streams.  If you just get the input stream then I believe it does a GET, sends the headers, then lets you read the output.  If you get the output stream then I believe it sends it as a POST, as it assumes you'll be writing data to it (You may need to call setDoOutput(true) for the output stream to work).  As soon as you get the input stream the output stream is closed and it waits for the response from the server.\nFor example, this should do a POST:\n\nWhile this would do a GET:\n\nURLConnection will also do other weird things.  If the server specifies a content length then URLConnection will keep the underlying input stream open until it receives that much data, even if you explicitly close it.  This caused a lot of problems for us as it made shutting our client down cleanly a bit hard, as the URLConnection would keep the network connection open.

However, I do not understand how I am supposed to be able to find the root reference (ref) or whatever it is called. Basically, I can tell that there are several hundred megabytes of hash table entries ([java.util.HashMap$Entry or something like that), but maps are used all over the place... Is there some way to search for large maps, or perhaps find general roots of large object trees?\n[Edit]\nOk, I've read the answers so far but let's just say I am a cheap bastard (meaning I am more interested in learning how to use JHat than to pay for JProfiler). Also, JHat is always available since it is part of the JDK. Unless of course there is no way with JHat but brute force, but I can't believe that can be the case.\nAlso, I do not think I will be able to actually modify (adding logging of all map sizes) and run it for long enough for me to notice the leak.\n",

        "You really need to use a memory profiler that tracks allocations. Take a look at JProfiler - their \"heap walker\" feature is great, and they have integration with all of the major Java IDEs. It's not free, but it isn't that expensive either ($499 for a single license) - you will burn $500 worth of time pretty quickly struggling to find a leak with less sophisticated tools.\n", 
        "There are tools that should help you find your leak, like JProbe, YourKit, AD4J or JRockit Mission Control. The last is the one that I personally know best. Any good tool should let you drill down to a level where you can easily identify what leaks, and where the leaking objects are allocated. \nUsing HashTables, Hashmaps or similar is one of the few ways that you can acually leak memory in Java at all. If I had to find the leak by hand I would peridically print the size of my HashMaps, and from there find the one where I add items and forget to delete them.\n", 
        "NetBeans has a built-in profiler. \n", 
        "A tool is a big help.\nHowever, there are times when you can't use a tool: the heap dump is so huge it crashes the tool, you are trying to troubleshoot a machine in some production environment to which you only have shell access, etc.\nIn that case, it helps to know your way around the hprof dump file.\nLook for SITES BEGIN. This shows you what objects are using the most memory. But the objects aren't lumped together solely by type: each entry also includes a \"trace\" ID. You can then search for that \"TRACE nnnn\" to see the top few frames of the stack where the object was allocated. Often, once I see where the object is allocated, I find a bug and I'm done. Also, note that you can control how many frames are recorded in the stack with the options to -Xrunhprof.\nIf you check out the allocation site, and don't see anything wrong, you have to start backward chaining from some of those live objects to root objects, to find the unexpected reference chain. This is where a tool really helps, but you can do the same thing by hand (well, with grep). There is not just one root object (i.e., object not subject to garbage collection). Threads, classes, and stack frames act as root objects, and anything they reference strongly is not collectible.\nTo do the chaining, look in the HEAP DUMP section for entries with the bad trace id. This will take you to an OBJ or ARR entry, which shows a unique object identifier in hexadecimal. Search for all occurrences of that id to find who's got a strong reference to the object. Follow each of those paths backward as they branch until you figure out where the leak is. See why a tool is so handy?\nStatic members are a repeat offender for memory leaks. In fact, even without a tool, it'd be worth spending a few minutes looking through your code for static Map members. Can a map grow large? Does anything ever clean up its entries?\n",

I've used jProfiler with great success, but I believe that any specialized tool with graphing capabilities (diffs are easier to analyze in graphical form) will work.\n\nStart the application and wait until it get to \"stable\" state, when all the initialization is complete and the application is idle.\nRun the operation suspected of producing a memory leak several times to allow any cache, DB-related initialization to take place.\nRun GC and take memory snapshot.\nRun the operation again. Depending on the complexity of operation and sizes of data that is processed operation may need to be run several to many times.\nRun GC and take memory snapshot.\nRun a diff for 2 snapshots and analyze it.\n\nBasically analysis should start from greatest positive diff by, say, object types and find what causes those extra objects to stick in memory.\nFor web applications that process requests in several threads analysis gets more complicated, but nevertheless general approach still applies.\nI did quite a number of projects specifically aimed at reducing memory footprint of the applications and this general approach with some application specific tweaks and trick always worked well.\n",

It also has a Find likely leak suspects which I reccon can come in handy, but since the navigation was enough for me I did not really get into it.\n", 
        "I joined a new company about a month ago. The company is rather small in size and has pretty strong \"start-up\" feel to it. I'm working as a Java developer on a team of 3 others. The company primarily sells a service to for businesses/business-type people to use in communicating with each other.\nOne of the main things I have been, and will be working on, is the main website for the company - from which the service is sold, existing users login to check their service and pay their bills, new users can sign up for a trial, etc. Currently this is a JSP application deployed on Tomcat, with access to a database done thru a persistence layer written by the company itself.\nA repeated and growing frustration I am having here (and I'm pretty happy with the job overall, so this isn't an \"oh no I don't like my job\"-type post) is the lack of any larger design or architecture for this web application. The app is made up of several dozen JSP pages, with almost no logic existing in Servlets or Beans or any other sort of framework. Many of the JSP pages are thousands of lines of code, they jsp:include other JSP pages, business logic is mixed in with the HTML, frequently used snippets of code (such as obtaining a web service connection) is cut and paste rather than reused, etc. In other words, the application is a mess.\nThere have been some rumblings within the company of trying to re-architect this site so that it fits MVC better; I think that the developers and higher-ups are beginning to realize that this current pattern of spaghetti code isn't sustainable or very easily scalable to add more features for the users. The higher-ups and developers are wary of completely re-writing the thing (with good reason, since this would mean several weeks or months of work re-writing existing functionality), but we've had some discussions of (slowly) re-writing certain areas of the site into a new framework.\nWhat are some of the best strategies to enable moving the application and codebase into this direction? How can I as a developer really help move this along, and quickly, without seeming like the jerk-y new guy who comes into a job and tells everyone that what they've written is crap? Are there any proven strategies or experiences that you've used in your own job experience when you've encountered this sort of thing?\n", 
        "Your best bet is probably to refactor it slowly as you go along.  Few us of have the resources that would be required to completely start from scratch with something that has so many business rules buried in it.  Management really hates it when you spend months on developing an app that has more bugs than the one you replaced.\nIf you have the opportunity to build any separate apps from scratch, use all of the best practices there and use it to demonstrate how effective they are.  When you can, incorporate those ideas gradually into the old application.\n", 
        "In my experience, the \"elegance\" of an app typically has more to do with the database design than anything.  If you have a great database design, including a well-defined stored procedure interface, good application code tends to follow no matter what platform you use.  If you have poor database design, no matter what platform you use you'll have a very difficult time building elegant application code, as you'll be constantly compensating for the database.\nOf course, there's plenty of room between great and poor, but my point is that if you want good application code, start by making sure your database is up to snuff.\n", 
        "This is harder to do in applications that are only in maintenance mode because it is hard to convince management that rewriting something that is already 'working' is worth doing. I would start by applying the principles of MVC to any new code that you are able to work on (ie. move business logic to something akin to a model, put all your layout/view code in one place)\nAs you gain experience with new code in MVC you can start seeing opportunities to change the existing code subtly so that it also falls in line. It can be a very slow process, but if you can show the benefits of this way of doing it then you will be able to convince others and get the entire team on board.\n", 
        "I would agree with the slow refactoring approach; for example, take that copy-and-pasted code and extract it into whatever the appropriate Java paradigm is (a class, perhaps? or better yet, use an existing library?). When your code is really clean and terse, yet still lacking in overall architectural strategy, then you'll be able to make things fit into an overall architecture much more easily.\n", 
        "The best way is to print out the code, crumple it up, and throw it out. Don't even recycle the paper.\nYou've got an application that is written in 1,000+ line long JSPs. It probably has a god-awful Domain Model (if it even has one at all) and doesn't just MIX presentation with business logic, it BLENDS it and sits there and keeps stirring for hours. There is no way to take out the code that is crappy and move into an MVC Controller class and still be doing the right thing, you'll just end up with a MVC app with an anemic domain model or one that has stuff like Database calls in Controller code, you're still failing. \nYou could try a new app that does the right thing and then have the two apps talk to each other, but that's new complexity in itself. Also you're likely going to be doing the same amount of work that you were going to do if you just started from scratch, but you might have an easier time trying to convince your bosses that this is  a better approach. \n", 
        "First pick up a copy of Michael Feather's Working Effectively with Legacy Code.  Then  identify how best to test the existing code.  The worst case is that you are stuck with just some high level regression tests (or nothing at all) and If you are lucky there will be unit tests.  Then it is a case of slow steady refactoring hopefully while adding new business functionality at the same time.\n", 
        "Iteratively refactor.  Also look for new features that can be done completely in the new framework as a way to show the value of the new framework.\n", 
        "My suggestion would be to find the rare pages that do not require an import of other JSPs, or have very few imports.  Treat each JSP imported as a black box, and refactor these pages around them (iteratively, testing each change and making sure it works before continuing).  Once these are cleaned up, you can continue finding pages with more and more imports, until finally you have refactored the imports.\nWhen refactoring, note the parts that try to access resources not given to the page and try to take this out to a controller.  For instance, anything that accesses the database should be inside a controller, let the JSP handle the display of the information the controller gives to it via a forward.  In this way you will develop several servlets, or things like servlets, for each page.  I would suggest using a front-controller based framework for this refactoring (from personal experience I recommend Spring and its Controller interface), so that each controller isn't a separate Servlet but is rather delegated to from a single servlet that is mapped appropriately.\nFor the controller, it is better to do database hits all at once rather than attempt them piecemeal.  Users can and generally do tolerate a page load, but the page output will be much faster if all the database data is given to the rendering code rather than the rendering code hanging and not giving data to the client while it is trying to read yet another piece of data from the database.\nI feel your pain and wish you luck in this endeavor.  Now, when you have to maintain an application that abuses Spring Webflow, that's another story :)\n",

Read the information that follows for important application notes.\n\nUsage examples\nCreate an insecure generator for 8-character identifiers:\n\nCreate a secure generator for session identifiers:\n\nCreate a generator with easy-to-read codes for printing. The strings are longer than full alphanumeric strings to compensate for using fewer symbols:\n\nUse as session identifiers\nGenerating session identifiers that are likely to be unique is not good enough, or you could just use a simple counter. Attackers hijack sessions when predictable identifiers are used.\nThere is tension between length and security. Shorter identifiers are easier to guess, because there are fewer possibilities. But longer identifiers consume more storage and bandwidth. A larger set of symbols helps, but might cause encoding problems if identifiers are included in URLs or re-entered by hand.\nThe underlying source of randomness, or entropy, for session identifiers should come from a random number generator designed for cryptography. However, initializing these generators can sometimes be computationally expensive or slow, so effort should be made to re-use them when possible.\nUse as object identifiers\nNot every application requires security. Random assignment can be an efficient way for multiple entities to generate identifiers in a shared space without any coordination or partitioning. Coordination can be slow, especially in a clustered or distributed environment, and splitting up a space causes problems when entities end up with shares that are too small or too big.\nIdentifiers generated without taking measures to make them unpredictable should be protected by other means if an attacker might be able to view and manipulate them, as happens in most web applications. There should be a separate authorization system that protects objects whose identifier can be guessed by an attacker without access permission.\nCare must be also be taken to use identifiers that are long enough to make collisions unlikely given the anticipated total number of identifiers. This is referred to as \"the birthday paradox.\" The probability of a collision, p, is approximately n2/(2qx), where n is the number of identifiers actually generated, q is the number of distinct symbols in the alphabet, and x is the length of the identifiers. This should be a very small number, like 2\u201150 or less.\nWorking this out shows that the chance of collision among 500k 15-character identifiers is about 2\u201152, which is probably less likely than undetected errors from cosmic rays, etc.\nComparison with UUIDs\nAccording to their specification, UUIDs are not designed to be unpredictable, and should not be used as session identifiers.\nUUIDs in their standard format take a lot of space: 36 characters for only 122 bits of entropy. (Not all bits of a \"random\" UUID are selected randomly.) A randomly chosen alphanumeric string packs more entropy in just 21 characters.\nUUIDs are not flexible; they have a standardized structure and layout. This is their chief virtue as well as their main weakness. When collaborating with an outside party, the standardization offered by UUIDs may be helpful.

        "In Java, static and transient fields are not serialized. However, I found out that initialization of static fields causes the generated serialVersionUID to be changed. For example, static int MYINT = 3; causes the serialVersionUID to change. In this example, it makes sense because different versions of the class would get different initial values. Why does any initialization change the serialVersionUID? For example, static String MYSTRING = System.getProperty(\"foo\"); also causes the serialVersionUID to change.\nTo be specific, my question is why does initialization with a method cause the serialVersionUID to change. The problem I hit is that I added a new static field that was initialized with a system property value (getProperty). That change caused a serialization exception on a remote call.\n", 
        "If I read the spec correctly the automatic serialVersionUID shouldn't change if you change the value of a static of transient field. Take a look at Chapter 5.6 of the Spec.\nHowever, if you think about this a bit - you start by serializing an object that has static int MYINT = 3, when you then deserialize the class you expect to get the same object back, that is, with MYINT = 3. So, if you change the static initialization you would expect the serialVersionUID to change because you can't get the same object back again.\nAnyways, keep this in all your serializable classes and you can control the serialVersionUID:\n\n", 
        "I updated the question to be more clear. I understand why initialization with a literal changes the serialVersionUID but not why dynamic initialization changes it. If you initialize with a method, the value, of course, may always be different.  \nSetting the serialVersionUID explicitly is fine in a subsequent version of the class only if you are sure that it is a safe change. \n", 
        "You can find some information about that in the bug 4365406 and in the algorithm for computing serialVersionUID. Basically, when changing the initialization of your static member with System.getProperty(), the compiler introduces a new static property in your class referencing the System class (I assume that the System class was previously unreferenced in your class), and since this property introduced by the compiler is not private, it takes part in the serialVersionUID computation.\nMorality: always use explicit serialVersionUID, you'll save some CPU cycles and some headaches :)\n", 
        "Automatic serialVersionUID is calculated based on members of a class. These can be shown for a class file using the javap tool in the Sun JDK.\nIn the case mentioned in the question, the member that is added/removed is the static initialiser. This appears as ()V in class files. The contents of the method can be disassembled using javap -c. You should be able to make out the System.getProperty(\"foo\") call and assignment to MYSTRING. However an assignment with a string literal (or any compile-time constant as defined by the Java Language Specification) is supported directly by the class file, so removing the need for a static initialiser.\nA common case for code targeting J2SE 1.4 (use -source 1.4 -target 1.4) or earlier is static fields to old Class instances which appear as class literals in source code (MyClass.class). The Class instance is looked up on demand with Class.forName, and the stored in a static field. It is this static field that disrupts the serialVersionUID. From J2SE 5.0, a variant of the ldc opcode gives direct support for class literals, removing the need for the synthetic field. Again, all this can be shown with javap -c.\n",

And since it is immutable, if I make a change to a node on the N'th level of the tree, I need to allocate at least N new nodes  in order to return the new tree.\nMy question is, would it be dramatically faster to pre-allocate nodes rather than create new ones every time the tree is modified? It would be fairly easy to do - keep a pool of several hundred unused nodes, and pull one out of the pool rather than create one whenever it was required for a modify operation. I can replenish the node pool when there's nothing else going on. (in case it isn't obvious, execution time is going to be much more at a premium in this application than heap space is)\nIs it worthwhile to do this? Any other tips on speeding it up?\nAlternatively, does anyone know if an immutable DOM library already? I searched, but couldn't find anything.\n*Note: For those of you who aren't familiar with the concept of immutability, it basically means that on any operation to an object that changes it, the method returns a copy of the object with the changes in place, rather than the changed object. Thus, if another thread is still reading the object it will continue to happily operate on the \"old\" version, unaware that changes have been made, rather than crashing horribly.

But since it is internal to the package, it can only be called as a descendent of addChild() and the structure as a whole is guarenteed to be thread safe (provided I synchronize access to the object pool). Do you see a flaw in this...? If so, please tell me!\n\nI think that using immutable nodes is probably not going to give you the kind of thread-safety you need in the first place. What happens if 1 thread is iterating over the nodes (a search or something), while another thread is adding/removing nodes?\n\nThe tree as a whole will be immutable. Say I have Thread1 and Thread2, and tree dom1. Thread1 starts a read operation on dom1, while, concurrently, Thread2 starts a write operation on dom1. However, all the changes Thread2 makes will actually be made to a new object, dom2, and dom1 will be immutable. It is true that the values read by Thread1 will be (a few microseconds) out of date, but it won't crash on an IndexOutOfBounds or NullPointer exception or something like it would if it was reading a mutable object that was being written to. Then, Thread2 can fire an event containing dom2 to Thread1 so that it can do its read again and update its results, if necessary.\nEdit: clarified\n", 
        "I think @Outlaw has a point. The structure of the DOM tree resides in the nodes itself, having a node pointing to its children. To modify the structure of a tree you have to modify the node, so you can't have it pooled, you have to create a new one.\nTry to think in a higher level. You have an IMMUTABLE tree (that is basically a set of nodes pointing to its children). You want to insert a node in it. Then, there's no way out: you have to create a new WHOLE tree. \nYes, the immutable tree is thread-safe, but it will impact performance.

You have an IMMUTABLE tree (that is basically a set of nodes pointing to its children). You want to insert a node in it. Then, there's no way out: you have to create a new WHOLE tree.\n\nIf you choose to implement the tree as a set of nodes pointing to the children, then you would have to create new nodes along the path of the changed node to the root. The others have the same value as before, and normally are shared. So you need to create a partial new tree, which usually would mean (depth of edited node) parent nodes.  \nIf you can cope with a less direct implementation, you should be able to get away with only creating parts of nodes, using techniques similar to those described in Purely Functional Data Structures to either reduce the average cost of the creation, or you can by-pass it using semi-functional approaches (such as creating an iterator which wraps an existing iterator, but returns the new node instead of the old, together with a mechanism to repair such patches in the structure as time goes on). An XPath style api might be better than a DOM api in that case - it might you decouple the nodes from the tree a bit more, and treat the mutated tree more intelligently. \n",

I use JPA and the change would affect the entire application, not only the prefetching queries and that's not acceptable for me.\nOn PostgreSQL I could do the following:\nselect setval('seq', nextval('seq') + n - 1 )\nThe solution by Matthew works when you can use a fixed increment value (which is perfectly acceptable in my case). However is there a solution when you don't want to fix the size of the increment, but want to adjust it dynamically?\n\n", 
        "Why not just have the sequence as increment by 100 all the time? each \"nextval\" gives you 100 sequence numbers to work with\n\nA note on your example.. Watch out for DDL.. It will produce an implicit commit\nExample of commit produced by DDL\n\n", 
        "Matthew has the correct approach here.  In my opinion, it is very unusual for an application to reset a sequence's current value after every use.  Much more conventional to set the increment size to whatever you need upfront.\nAlso, this way is much more performant.  Selecting nextval from a sequence is a highly optimised operation in Oracle, whereas running ddl to alter the sequence is much more expensive.\nI guess that doesn't really answer the last point in your edited question...\n", 
        "Why do you need to fetch the sequence IDs in the first place?  In most cases you would insert into a table and return the ID.\n\nIt sounds like you are trying to pre-optimize the processing.\nIf you REALLY need to pre-fetch the IDs then just call the sequence 100 times.  The entire point of a sequence is that it manages the numbering.  You're not supposed to assume that you can get 100 consecutive numbers.\n", 
        "For when you don't want a fixed size increment, sequences aren't really what you are after, all they really guarantee is that you will be getting a unique number always bigger than the last one you got. There is always the possibility that you'll end up with gaps, and you can't really adjust the increment amount on the fly safely or effectively. \nI can't really think of any case where I've had to do this kind of thing, but likely the easiest way is just to store the \"current\" number somewhere and update it as you need it.\nSomething like this.\n\n",

You supplied a pattern and it moved the text entry cursor through the elements of that pattern, only allowing valid values.\nAs part of that I wrote a DateFormatParser available here as part of the OpenHarmonise open source project.\nParsing a date into a pattern would be an extremely interesting problem to tackle. You would have to make certain assumptions (e.g. use of : in time not date) but you would face the eternal problems of 2 digit years and day/month or month/day arrangements.\n",

If you limit yourself on a subset of expected formats, you could probably solve problem by playing around with regexps, you could build up bunch of expected patterns, and then break Strings on spaces or whatever, and match part by part.\n", 
        "It's worth knowing that the date format you have given is not an arbitrary one. It is the output of the built-in Date.toString() method (at least in the UK and US locales). Not coincidentally, it is also the format of the unix 'date' command (at least on linux, and I believe in other implementations too) - though to be pedantic, Date.toString() pads one-digit day numbers with a zero while unix date does not.\nWhat this means is that you are likely to receive this input format when you output an unformatted date into a user-modifiable field (e.g. an HTML INPUT field) and receive it back unmodified. So just because input is coming in this format, doesn't mean the users will type in a thousand other arbitrary formats.\nOf course, they still might. The way I handle date inputs in general is with a bunch of try/catch blocks, where I try it against one format, then another, then another. Our standard framework is now up to about 20 different formats by default. Of course it is still not perfect; I found someone the other day entering \"03 Sept\" as the date (a non-standard month abbreviation, and with no year) and we hadn't handled that scenario.\n",

This construct, and the new keywords delegate and\n  multicast introduced to support it, are not a part of the JavaTM\n  programming language, which is specified by the Java Language\n  Specification and amended by the Inner Classes Specification included\n  in the documentation for the JDKTM 1.1 software. \nIt is unlikely that the Java programming language will ever include\n  this construct. Sun already carefully considered adopting it in 1996,\n  to the extent of building and discarding working prototypes. Our\n  conclusion was that bound method references are unnecessary and\n  detrimental to the language. This decision was made in consultation\n  with Borland International, who had previous experience with bound\n  method references in Delphi Object Pascal. \nWe believe bound method references are unnecessary because another\n  design alternative, inner classes, provides equal or superior\n  functionality. In particular, inner classes fully support the\n  requirements of user-interface event handling, and have been used to\n  implement a user-interface API at least as comprehensive as the\n  Windows Foundation Classes. \nWe believe bound method references are harmful because they detract\n  from the simplicity of the Java programming language and the\n  pervasively object-oriented character of the APIs. Bound method\n  references also introduce irregularity into the language syntax and\n  scoping rules. Finally, they dilute the investment in VM technologies\n  because VMs are required to handle additional and disparate types of\n  references and method linkage efficiently.\n\n", 
        "Not really, no.\nYou may be able to achieve the same effect by using reflection to get Method objects you can then invoke, and the other way is to create an interface with a single 'invoke' or 'execute' method, and then instantiate them to call the method your interested in (i.e. using an anonymous inner class).\nYou might also find this article interesting / useful : A Java Programmer Looks at C# Delegates\n",

What are people's opinions on label statements?\n", 
        "I'm curious to hear what your alternative to labels is.  I think this is pretty much going to boil down to the argument of \"return as early as possible\" vs. \"use a variable to hold the return value, and only return at the end.\"\nLabels are pretty standard when you have nested loops.  The only way they really decrease readability is when another developer has never seen them before and doesn't understand what they mean.\n", 
        "I never use labels in my code. I prefer to create a guard and initialize it to null or other unusual value. This guard is often a result object. I haven't seen any of my coworkers using labels, nor found any in our repository. It really depends on your style of coding. In my opinion using labels would decrease the readability as it's not a common construct and usually it's not used in Java. \n",

On the other hand, it may indicate an overly complex solution. So stand back and look at the problem.\nSome people prefer a \"single entry, single exit\" approach to all loops. That is to say avoiding break (and continue) and early return for loops altogether. This may result in some duplicate code.\nWhat I would strongly avoid doing is introducing auxilary variables. Hiding control-flow within state adds to confusion.\nSplitting labeled loops into two methods may well be difficult. Exceptions are probably too heavyweight. Try a single entry, single exit approach.\n", 
        "Labels are like goto's: Use them sparingly, and only when they make your code faster and more importantly, more understandable, \n\ne.g., If you are in big loops six levels deep and you encounter a condition that makes the rest of the loop pointless to complete, there's no sense in having 6 extra trap doors in your condition statements to exit out the loop early.\n\nLabels (and goto's) aren't evil, it's just that sometimes people use them in bad ways. Most of the time we are actually trying to write our code so it is understandable for you and the next programmer who comes along. Making it uber-fast is a secondary concern (be wary of premature optimization).\nWhen Labels (and goto's) are misused they make the code less readable, which causes grief for you and the next developer. The compiler doesn't care.\n",

If you really want to break across nested loops, see if you can refactor your method so that an early return statement does what you want.\nTechnically, I guess there's not much difference between an early return and a label. Practically, though, almost every Java developer has seen an early return and knows what it does. I'd guess many developers would at least be surprised by a label, and probably be confused.\nI was taught the single entry / single exit orthodoxy in school, but I've since come to appreciate early return statements and breaking out of loops as a way to simplify code and make it clearer.\n",

But I can't think of a reason why anyone would write it like that. Most likely it makes no difference to performance what you do.\nAnd yes, the order will depend on the implementation - as well as (possibly) the order of insertion and other hard-to-control factors.\n[edit] I wrote valueSet() originally but of course entrySet() is actually the answer.\n",

LinkedHashMap will either return entries in insertion-order or access-order depending upon how it has been constructed. EnumMap returns entries in natural order of keys.\nNote, IdentityHashMap entrySet iterator currently has a peculiar implementation which returns the same Map.Entry instance for every item in the entrySet! However, every time a new the iterator advances the Map.Entry is updated.\n",

So you shouldn't really rely on the ordering given by any implementation.  However, the SortedMap interface extends Map and provides exactly what you are looking for - implementations will aways give a consistent sort order.\nNavigableMap is another useful extension - this is a SortedMap with additional methods for finding entries by their ordered position in the key set.  So potentially this can remove the need for iterating in the first place - you might be able to find the specific entry you are after using the higherEntry, lowerEntry, ceilingEntry, or floorEntry methods.

And can you share your experiences from the project? Also, did you consider any other technologies and (if so) why did you chose Stripes?\n",

We implemented a robust security framework using annotations and interceptors. We're using spring for dependency injection and stripes has excellent support for that.\nI'd definitely use the new 1.5 release if you're going to use it.\nI'm a huge fan of the framework. I came from a struts background and it's the exact framework I was looking for. The other developers on our team really enjoy using the stripes framework.\nI just bought the stripes beta book from the pragmatic programmer's site. It's a great resource on Stripes 1.5.\n", 
        "We use stripes now on all our production sites, and have been for about a year now. It is an awesome product compared to struts, which we used to use before that. Just the fact that there are literally no XML config files and that you can set it all up with a minimal amount of classes and annotations is awesome.\nIn terms of scaling & speed it actually seems to be better than struts, and my guess would be because there are less layers involved. The code you end up with is a lot cleaner as well, because you don't have to go off to seperate XML files to find out where redirects are going.\nWe use it with an EJB3 backend, and the two seem to work really well together, because you can use your EJB POJO inside your actionBean object, without needing a form object like in struts.\nIn our evaluation we considered an alpha version of struts (that supported annotations) and a lot of other frameworks, but stripes won because of it's superior documentation, stability and clean-ness.\nCouldn't figure out how to leave a comment: so to answer your second question we haven't encountered a single bug in Stripes that I know of. This is quite impressive for an open source framework. I haven't tried the latest version (1.5) yet, but 1.4.x is very stable.\n",

Not much configuration is necessary, as others have already mentioned.  Very quick development and allows you to focus on presentation etc. instead of hassling with the framework.  \nIf I had to start a fresh new project and I had my say, I would choose either Stripes or JSF.  I might have been scared away from Stripes if I had to make the decision to switch to it, because it kind of looks/feels like a sourceforge basement project instead of a enterprise-grade framework, but it seems to be fairly solid.

        "Assuming String a and b:\n\nUnder the hood, are they the same thing?\nHere is concat decompiled as reference. I'd like to be able to decompile the + operator as well to see what that does.\n\n", 
        "The + operator can work between a string and a string, char, integer, double or float data type value. It just converts the value to its string representation before concatenation.\nThe concat operator can only be done on and with strings. It checks for data type compatibility and throws an error, if they don't match.\nExcept this, the code you provided does the same stuff.\n", 
        "I don't think so. a.concat(b) is implemented in String and I think the implementation didn't change much since early java machines. The + operation implementation depends on java version and compiler. Currently + is implemented using StringBuffer to make the operation as fast as possible. Maybe in future this will change. In earlier versions of java + operation on Strings was much slower as it produced intermediate results. I guess that += is implemented using + and similarly optimized.\n", 
        "Niyaz is correct, but it's also worth noting that the special + operator can be converted into something more efficient by the Java compiler.  Java has a StringBuilder class which represents a non-thread-safe, mutable String.  When performing a bunch of String concatenations, the Java compiler silently converts\n\ninto\n\nwhich for large strings is significantly more efficient.  As far as I know, this does not happen when you use the concat method.\nHowever, the concat method is more efficient when concatenating an empty String onto an existing String.  In this case, the JVM does not need to create a new String object and can simply return the existing one.  See the concat documentation to confirm this.\nSo if you're super-concerned about efficiency then you should use the concat method when concatenating possibly-empty Strings, and use + otherwise.  However, the performance difference should be negligible and you probably shouldn't ever worry about this.\n", 
        "No, not quite.\nFirstly, there's a slight difference in semantics. If a is null, then a.concat(b) throws a NullPointerException but a+=b will treat the original value of a as if it were null. Furthermore, the concat() method only accepts String values while the + operator will silently convert the argument to a String (using the toString() method for objects). So the concat() method is more strict in what it accepts.\nTo look under the hood, write a simple class with a += b;\n\nNow disassemble with javap -c (included in the Sun JDK). You should see a listing including:\n\nSo, a += b is the equivalent of\n\nThe concat method should be faster. However, with more strings the StringBuilder method wins, at least in terms of performance.\nThe source code of String and StringBuilder (and its package-private base class) is available in src.zip of the Sun JDK. You can see that you are building up a char array (resizing as necessary) and then throwing it away when you create the final String. In practice memory allocation is surprisingly fast.\n", 
        "How about some simple testing? Used the code below:\n\n\nThe \"a + b\" version executed in 2500ms.\nThe a.concat(b) executed in 1200ms.\n\nTested several times. The concat() version execution took half of the time on average.\nThis result surprised me because the concat() method always creates a new string (it returns a \"new String(result)\". It's well known that:\n\nWhy wasn't the compiler capable of optimize the string creation in \"a + b\" code, knowing the it always resulted in the same string? It could avoid a new string creation.\nIf you don't believe the statement above, test for your self. \n", 
        "Tom is correct in describing exactly what the + operator does.  It creates a temporary StringBuilder, appends the parts, and finishes with toString().\nHowever, all of the answers so far are ignoring the effects of HotSpot runtime optimizations.  Specifically, these temporary operations are recognized as a common pattern and are replaced with more efficient machine code at run-time.\n@marcio: You've created a micro-benchmark; with modern JVM's this is not a valid way to profile code.\nThe reason run-time optimization matters is that many of these differences in code -- even including object-creation -- are completely different once HotSpot gets going.  The only way to know for sure is profiling your code in situ.\nFinally, all of these methods are in fact incredibly fast.  This might be a case of premature optimization.  If you have code that concatenates strings a lot, the way to get maximum speed probably has nothing to do with which operators you choose and instead the algorithm you're using!\n", 
        "I ran a similar test as @marcio but with the following loop instead:\n\nJust for good measure, I threw in StringBuilder.append() as well.  Each test was run 10 times, with 100k reps for each run.  Here are the results:\n\nStringBuilder wins hands down.  The clock time result was 0 for most the runs, and the longest took 16ms.\na += b takes about 40000ms (40s) for each run.\nconcat only requires 10000ms (10s) per run.\n\nI haven't decompiled the class to see the internals or run it through profiler yet, but I suspect a += b spends much of the time creating new objects of StringBuilder and then converting them back to String.\n", 
        "The Weblogic servers we are using have been configured to allow JNDI datasource names like \"appds\".\nFor development (localhost), we might be running Tomcat and when declared in the <context> section of server.xml, Tomcat will hang JNDI datasources on \"java:comp/env/jdbc/*\" in the JNDI tree.\nProblem: in Weblogic, the JNDI lookup is \"appds\" whilst in Tomcat, it seems that that I must provide the formal \"java:comp/env/jdbc/appds\". I'm afraid the Tomcat version is an implicit standard but unfortunately, I can't change Weblogic's config ... so that means we end up with two different spring config files (we're using spring 2.5) to facilitate the different environments.\nIs there an elegant way to address this.

        "I was surprised recently to find that it's possible to have a return statement in a finally block in Java.\nIt seems like lots of people think it's a bad thing to do as described in 'Don't return in a finally clause'. Scratching a little deeper, I also found 'Java's return doesn't always' which shows some pretty horrible examples of other types of flow control in finally blocks.\nSo, my question is, can anyone give me an example where a return statement (or other flow control) in a finally block produces better / more readable code?\n", 
        "The examples you provided are reason enough to not use flow-control from finally.\nEven if there's a contrived example where it's \"better,\" consider the developer who has to maintain your code later and who might not be aware of the subtleties.

        "Adding control structures and returns to finally{} blocks are just another example of \"just because you can\" abuses which are scattered throughout virtually all development languages.  Jason was right in suggesting it could easily become a maintenance nightmare - the arguments against early returns from functions apply more-so to this case of \"late returns\".\nFinally blocks exist for one purpose, to allow you to completely tidy up after yourself, no matter what happened in all the preceeding code. Principally this is closing / releasing file pointers, database connections etc., though I could see it being stretched to say adding in bespoke auditing.\nAnything that affects the return of the function should lie in the try{} block.  Even if you had a method whereby you checked an external state, did a time consuming operation, then checked that state again in case it became invalid, you would still want the second check inside the try{} - if it sat inside finally{} and the long operation failed, you would then be checking that state a second time needlessly.\n",

        "I had a REALLY hard time to track down a bug years ago that was caused by this. The code was something like:\n\nWhat happened is that the exception was thrown down in some other code. It was being caught and logged and rethrown within the somethingThatThrewAnException() method. But the exception wasn't being propagated up past problemMethod(). After a LONG time of looking at this we finally tracked it down to the return method. The return method in the finally block was basically stopping the exception that happened in the try block from propagating up even though it wasn't caught.\nLike others have said, while it is legal to return from a finally block according to the Java spec, it is a BAD thing and shouldn't be done.\n", 
        "It seems like anything you can do with bytecode you can do just as easily and much faster in native code. In theory, you could even retain platform and language independence by distributing programs and libraries in bytecode then compiling to native code at installation, rather than JITing it.\nSo in general, when would you want to execute bytecode instead of native?\n", 
        "I think you just answered your own question: platform independence. Platform-independent bytecode is produced and distributed to its target platform. When executed it's quickly compiled to native code either before execution begins, or simultaneously (Just In Time). The Java JVM and presumably the .NET runtimes operate on this principle.\n", 
        "Bytecode creates an extra level of indirection.\nThe advantages of this extra level of indirection are:\n\nPlatform independence\nCan create any number of programming languages (syntax) and have them compile down to the same bytecode.\nCould easily create cross language converters\nx86, x64, and IA64 no longer need to be compiled as seperate binaries. Only the proper virtual machine needs to be installed.\nEach OS simply needs to create a virtual machine and it will have support for the same program.\nJust in time compilation allows you to update a program just by replacing a single patched source file.  (Very beneficial for web pages)\n\nSome of the disadvantages:\n\nPerformance\nEasier to decompile\n\n", 
        "Hank Shiffman from SGI said (a long time ago, but it's till true):\n\nThere are three advantages of Java\n  using byte code instead of going to\n  the native code of the system:\n\nPortability: Each kind of computer has its unique instruction\n  set. While some processors include the\n  instructions for their predecessors,\n  it's generally true that a program\n  that runs on one kind of computer\n  won't run on any other. Add in the\n  services provided by the operating\n  system, which each system describes in\n  its own unique way, and you have a\n  compatibility problem. In general, you\n  can't write and compile a program for\n  one kind of system and run it on any\n  other without a lot of work. Java gets\n  around this limitation by inserting\n  its virtual machine between the\n  application and the real environment\n  (computer + operating system). If an\n  application is compiled to Java byte\n  code and that byte code is interpreted\n  the same way in every environment then\n  you can write a single program which\n  will work on all the different\n  platforms where Java is supported.\n  (That's the theory, anyway. In\n  practice there are always small\n  incompatibilities lying in wait for\n  the programmer.)\nSecurity: One of Java's virtues is its integration into the Web. Load\n  a web page that uses Java into your\n  browser and the Java code is\n  automatically downloaded and executed.\n  But what if the code destroys files,\n  whether through malice or sloppiness\n  on the programmer's part? Java\n  prevents downloaded applets from doing\n  anything destructive by disallowing\n  potentially dangerous operations.\n  Before it allows the code to run it\n  examines it for attempts to bypass\n  security. It verifies that data is\n  used consistently: code that\n  manipulates a data item as an integer\n  at one stage and then tries to use it\n  as a pointer later will be caught and\n  prevented from executing. (The Java\n  language doesn't allow pointer\n  arithmetic, so you can't write Java\n  code to do what we just described.\n  However, there is nothing to prevent\n  someone from writing destructive byte\n  code themselves using a hexadecimal\n  editor or even building a Java byte\n  code assembler.) It generally isn't\n  possible to analyze a program's\n  machine code before execution and\n  determine whether it does anything\n  bad. Tricks like writing\n  self-modifying code mean that the evil\n  operations may not even exist until\n  later. But Java byte code was designed\n  for this kind of validation: it\n  doesn't have the instructions a\n  malicious programmer would use to hide\n  their assault.\nSize: In the microprocessor world RISC is generally preferable\n  over CISC. It's better to have a small\n  instruction set and use many fast\n  instructions to do a job than to have\n  many complex operations implemented as\n  single instructions. RISC designs\n  require fewer gates on the chip to\n  implement their instructions, allowing\n  for more room for pipelines and other\n  techniques to make each instruction\n  faster. In an interpreter, however,\n  none of this matters. If you want to\n  implement a single instruction for the\n  switch statement with a variable\n  length depending on the number of case\n  clauses, there's no reason not to do\n  so. In fact, a complex instruction set\n  is an advantage for a web-based\n  language: it means that the same\n  program will be smaller (fewer\n  instructions of greater complexity),\n  which means less time to transfer\n  across our speed-limited network.\n\n\nSo when considering byte code vs native, consider which trade-offs you want to make between portability, security, size, and execution speed. If speed is the only important factor, go native. If any of the others are more important, go with bytecode.\nI'll also add that maintaining a series of OS and architecture-targeted compilations of the same code base for every release can become very tedious. It's a huge win to use the same Java bytecode on multiple platforms and have it \"just work.\"\n", 
        "Ideally you would have portable bytecode that compiles Just In Time to native code.  I think the reason bytecode interpreters exist without JIT is due primarily to the practical fact that native code compilation adds complexity to a virtual machine.  It takes time to build, debug, and maintain that additional component.  Not everyone has the time or resources to make that commitment.\nA secondary factor is safety.  It's much easier to verify an interpreter won't crash than to guarantee the same for native code.\nThird is performance.  It can often take more time to generate machine code than to interpret bytecode for small pieces of code that only run once.\n", 
        "The performance of essentially any program will improve if it is compiled, executed with profiling, and the results fed back into the compiler for a second pass. The code paths which are actually used will be more aggressively optimized, loops unrolled to exactly the right degree, and the hot instruction paths arranged to maximize I$ hits.\nAll good stuff, yet it is almost never done because it is annoying to go through so many steps to build a binary.\nThis is the advantage of running the bytecode for a while before compiling it to native code: profiling information is automatically available. The result after Just-In-Time compilation is highly optimized native code for the specific data the program is processing.\nBeing able to run the bytecode also enables more aggressive native optimization than a static compiler could safely use. For example if one of the arguments to a function is noted to always be NULL, all handling for that argument can simply be omitted from the native code. There will be a brief validity check of the arguments in the function prologue, if that argument is not NULL the VM aborts back to the bytecode and starts profiling again.\n",

While the performance packs offer the ability to use the native platform's media library, they're only offered for Linux, Solaris and Windows. Furthermore, Windows-based JMF developers can unwittingly think JMF provides support for more formats than it does, and be surprised when their application is unable to play those formats on other platforms.\nAnother knock against JMF is Sun's seeming abandonment of it.

Now I need to do a similar thing and are going to throw the question to the masses.\nMy current plan is when the first user (probably me) enters the site it starts a background thread that waits until the alloted time (hourly on the hour) and then kicks off the event blocking the others (I am a Windows programmer by trade so I think in terms of events and WaitOnMultipleObjects) until it completes.\nHow did Jeff do it in Asp.Net and is his method applicable to the Java web-app world?\n", 
        "Jeff's mechanism was to create some sort of cached object which ASP.Net would automatically recreate at some sort of interval - It seemed to be an ASP.Net specific solution, so probably won't help you (or me) much in Java world.\nSee https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W13117\n\nAtwood: Well, I originally asked on Twitter, because I just wanted something light weight.  I really didn't want to like write a windows service.  I felt like that was out of band code. Plus the code that actually does the work is a web page in fact, because to me that is a logical unit of work on a website is a web page.  So, it really is like we are calling back into the web site, it's just like another request in the website, so I viewed it as something that should stay inline, and the little approach that we came up that was recommended to me on Twitter was to essentially to add something to the application cache with a fixed expiration, then you have a call back so when that expires it calls a certain function which does the work then you add it back in to the cache with the same expiration.  So, it's a little bit, maybe \"ghetto\" is the right word.\n\nMy approach has always been to have to OS (i.e. Cron or the Windows task scheduler) load a specific URL at some interval, and then setup a page at that URL to check it's queue, and perform whatever tasks were required, but I'd be interested to hear if there's a better way.\nFrom the transcript, it looks like FogBugz uses the windows service loading a URL approach also.\n\nSpolsky: So we have this special page called heartbeat.asp.  And that page, whenever you hit it, and anybody can hit it at anytime: doesn't hurt.  But when that page runs it checks a queue of waiting tasks to see if there's anything that needs to be done.  And if there's anything that needs to be done, it does one thing and then looks in that queue again and if there's anything else to be done it returns a plus, and the entire web page that it returns is just a single character with a plus in it.  And if there's nothing else to be done, the queue is now empty, it returns a minus.  So, anybody can call this and hit it as many times, you can load up heartbeat.asp in your web browser you hit Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R until you start getting minuses instead of pluses.  And when you've done that FogBugz will have completed all of its maintenance work that it needs to do.  So that's the first part, and the second part is a very, very simple Windows service which runs, and its whole job is to call heartbeat.asp and if it gets a plus, call it again soon, and if it gets a minus call it again, but not for a while.  So basically there's this Windows service that's always running, that has a very, very, very simple task of just hitting a URL, and looking to see if it gets a plus or a minus and, and then scheduling when it runs again based on whether it got a plus or a minus.  And obviously you can do any kind of variation you want on this theme, like for example, uh you could actually, instead of returning just a plus or minus you could say \"Okay call me back in 60 seconds\" or \"Call me back right away I have more work to be done.\"  And that's how it works... so that maintenance service it just runs, you know, it's like, you know, a half page of code that runs that maintenance service, and it never has to change, and it doesn't have any of the logic in there, it just contains the tickling that causes these web pages to get called with a certain guaranteed frequency.  And inside that web page at heartbeat.asp there's code that maintains a queue of tasks that need to be done and looks at how much time has elapsed and does, you know, late-night maintenance and every seven days delete all the older messages that have been marked as spam and all kinds of just maintenance background tasks.  And uh, that's how that does that.\n\n",

In your situation most probably you should settle with SimpleTrigger that lets you run jobs in fixed, regular intervals.\nThe jobs themselves can be described easily too in Quartz, however you haven't provided any details about what you need to run, so I can't provide a suggestion in that area.\n", 
        "As mentioned, Quartz is one standard solution. If you don't care about clustering or persistence of background tasks across restarts, you can use the built in  ThreadPool support (in Java 5,6). If you use a ScheduledExecutorService you can put Runnables into the background thread pool that wait a specific amount of time before executing. \nIf you do care about clustering and/or persistence, you can use JMS queues for asynchronous execution, though you will still need some way of delaying background tasks (you can use Quartz or the ScheduledExecutorService to do this).\n",

You can read more about synchronization in Java Concurrency in Practice.\nThe difference between Hashtable (note that the T is not a capital letter) and HashMap is similiar, the former is synchronized, the latter is not synchronized.\nI would say that there are no rule of thumb for preferring one implementation or another, it really depends on your needs.\n",

It has nice little tables in Chapter five to help one figure out what is appropriate.  \nOk, maybe if I know off the cuff that a simple ArrayList or HashSet will do the trick I won't look it all up.  ;)  but if there is anything remotely complex about my indended use, you bet I'm in the book.

        "Lists allow duplicate items, while Sets allow only one instance.\nI'll use a Map whenever I'll need to perform a lookup.\nFor the specific implementations, there are order-preserving variations of Maps and Sets but largely it comes down to speed. I'll tend to use ArrayList for reasonably small Lists and HashSet for reasonably small sets, but there are many implementations (including any that you write yourself). HashMap is pretty common for Maps. Anything more than 'reasonably small' and you have to start worrying about memory so that'll be way more specific algorithmically.\nThis page has lots of animated images along with sample code testing LinkedList vs. ArrayList if you're interested in hard numbers.\nEDIT: I hope the following links demonstrate how these things are really just items in a toolbox, you just have to think about what your needs are: See Commons-Collections versions of Map, List and Set.\n", 
        "I'll assume you know the difference between a List, Set and Map from the above answers. Why you would choose between their implementing classes is another thing. For example:\nList:\n\nArrayList is quick on retrieving, but slow on inserting. It's good for an implementation that reads a lot but doesn't insert/remove a lot. It keeps its data in one continuous block of memory, so every time it needs to expand, it copies the whole array.\nLinkedList is slow on retrieving, but quick on inserting. It's good for an implementation that inserts/removes a lot but doesn't read a lot. It doesn't keep the entire array in one continuous block of memory.\n\nSet:\n\nHashSet doesn't guarantee the order of iteration, and therefore is fastest of the sets. It has high overhead and is slower than ArrayList, so you shouldn't use it except for a large amount of data when its hashing speed becomes a factor.\nTreeSet keeps the data ordered, therefore is slower than HashSet.\n\nMap: The performance and behavior of HashMap and TreeMap are parallel to the Set implementations.\nVector and Hashtable should not be used.

It's rare that you would want synchronised implementations, and when you do their interfaces are not sufficiently rich for thier synchronisation to be useful. In the case of Map, ConcurrentMap adds extra operations to make the interface useful. ConcurrentHashMap is a good implementation of ConcurrentMap.\nLinkedList is almost never a good idea. Even if you are doing a lot of insertions and removal, if you are using an index to indicate position then that requires iterating through the list to find the correct node. ArrayList is almost always faster.\nFor Map and Set, the hash variants will be faster than tree/sorted. Hash algortihms tend to have O(1) performance, whereas trees will be O(log n).\n",

For example, linked-lists require an additional object allocation for every node, meaning slower to create a node and vastly worse memory-access characteristics.\nMy rule is:\n\nAlways start with ArrayList and HashSet and HashMap  (i.e. not LinkedList or TreeMap).\nType declarations should always be an interface (i.e. List, Set, Map) so if a profiler or code review proves otherwise you can change the implementation without breaking anything.\n\n",

        "Our design has one jvm that is a jboss/webapp (read/write) that is used to maintain the data via hibernate (using jpa) to the db. The model has 10-15 persistent classes with 3-5 levels of depth in the relationships.\nWe then have a separate jvm that is the server using this data.  As it is running continuously we just have one long db session (read only).  \nThere is currently no intra-jvm cache involved - so we manually signal one jvm from the other.\nNow when the webapp changes some data, it signals the server to reload the changed data.  What we have found is that we need to tell hibernate to purge the data and then reload it.  Just doing a fetch/merge with the db does not do the job - mainly in respect of the objects several layers down the hierarchy.  \nAny thoughts on whether there is anything fundamentally wrong with this design or if anyone is doing this and has had better luck with working with hibernate on the reloads.\nThanks,\nChris\n", 
        "Chris, I'm a little confused about your circumstances. If I understand correctly, you have a both a web app (read/write) a standalone application (read-only?) using Hibernate to access a shared database. The changes you make with the web app aren't visible to the standalone app. Is that right?\nIf so, have you considered using a different second-level cache implementation? I'm wondering if you might be able to use a clustered cache that is shared by both the web application and the standalone application. I believe that SwarmCache, which is integrated with Hibernate, will allow this, but I haven't tried it myself.\nIn general, though, you should know that the contents of a given cache will never be aware of activity by another application (that's why I suggest having both apps share a cache). Good luck!\n", 
        "A Hibernate session loads all data it reads from the DB into what they call the first-level cache. Once a row is loaded from the DB, any subsequent fetches for a row with the same PK will return the data from this cache. Furthermore, Hibernate gaurentees reference equality for objects with the same PK in a single Session. \nFrom what I understand, your read-only server application never closes its Hibernate session. So when the DB gets updated by the read-write application, the Session on read-only server is unaware of the change. Effectively, your read-only application is loading an in-memory copy of the database and using that copy, which gets stale in due course.\nThe simplest and best course of action I can suggest is to close and open Sessions as needed. This sidesteps the whole problem. Hibernate Sessions are intended to be a window for a short-lived interaction with the DB. I agree that there is a performance gain by not reloading the object-graph again and again; but you need to measure it and convince yourself that it is worth the pains.\nAnother option is to close and reopen the Session periodically. This ensures that the read-only application works with data not older than a given time interval. But there definitely is a window where the read-only application works with stale data (although the design guarantees that it gets the up-to-date data eventually). This might be permissible in many applications - you need to evaluate your situation. \nThe third option is to use a second level cache implementation, and use short-lived Sessions. There are various caching packages that work with Hibernate with relative merits and demerits.\n",

Array.sort is a good example.  Autoboxing helps, although it makes things awkward when something turns out to be null.\nProperties.  Python lets you create classes with read-only fields, lazily-generated fields, as well as fields which are checked upon assignment to make sure they're never 0 or null or whatever you want to guard against, etc.'\nDefault and keyword arguments.

The ReentrantLock does allow you to get its owner (but its a protected method, so you'd have to extend this). Depending on your application, it may well be that by using the concurrency packages, you'll find that you don't need to get the lock's owner after all.\nThere are non-programmatic methods to find the lock owners, such as signaling the JVM to issue a thread dump to stderr, that are useful to determine the cause of deadlocks.\n",

        "I have an application that's a mix of Java and C++ on Solaris. The Java aspects of the code run the web UI and establish state on the devices that we're talking to, and the C++ code does the real-time crunching of data coming back from the devices. Shared memory is used to pass device state and context information from the Java code through to the C++ code. The Java code uses a PostgreSQL database to persist its state.\nWe're running into some pretty severe performance bottlenecks, and right now the only way we can scale is to increase memory and CPU counts. We're stuck on the one physical box due to the shared memory design.\n\nThe really big hit here is being taken by the C++ code. The web interface is fairly lightly used to configure the devices; where we're really struggling is to handle the data volumes that the devices deliver once configured.\nEvery piece of data we get back from the device has an identifier in it which points back to the device context, and we need to look that up. Right now there's a series of shared memory objects that are maintained by the Java/UI code and referred to by the C++ code, and that's the bottleneck. Because of that architecture we cannot move the C++ data handling off to another machine. We need to be able to scale out so that various subsets of devices can be handled by different machines, but then we lose the ability to do that context lookup, and that's the problem I'm trying to resolve: how to offload the real-time data processing to other boxes while still being able to refer to the device context.\nI should note we have no control over the protocol used by the devices themselves, and there is no possible chance that situation will change.\n\nWe know we need to move away from this to be able to scale out by adding more machines to the cluster, and I'm in the early stages of working out exactly how we'll do this.\nRight now I'm looking at Terracotta as a way of scaling out the Java code, but I haven't got as far as working out how to scale out the C++ to match.\nAs well as scaling for performance we need to consider high availability as well. The application needs to be available pretty much the whole time -- not absolutely 100%, which isn't cost effective, but we need to do a reasonable job of surviving a machine outage.\nIf you had to undertake the task I've been given, what would you do?\nEDIT: Based on the data provided by @john channing, i'm looking at both GigaSpaces and Gemstone. Oracle Coherence and IBM ObjectGrid appear to be java-only.\n", 
        "You need to scale sideways and out. Maybe something like a message queue could be the backend between the frontend and the crunching.\n", 
        "The first thing I would do is construct a model of the system to map the data flow and try to understand precisely where the bottleneck lies.  If you can model your system as a pipeline, then you should be able to use the theory of constraints (most of the literature is about optimising business processes but it applies equally to software) to continuously improve performance and eliminate the bottleneck.\nNext I would collect some hard empirical data that accurately characterises the performance of your system. It is something of a clich\u00e9 that you cannot manage what you cannot measure, but I have seen many people attempt to optimise a software system based on hunches and fail miserably.\nThen I would use the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to choose the small number of things that will produce the biggest gains and focus only on those.\nTo scale a Java application horizontally, I have used Oracle Coherence extensively.  Although some dismiss it as a very expensive distributed hashtable, the functionality is much richer than that and you can, for example, directly access data in the cache from C++ code .\nOther alternatives for horizontally scaling your Java code would be Giga Spaces, IBM Object Grid or Gemstone Gemfire.\nIf your C++ code is stateless and is used purely for number crunching, you could look at distributing the process using ICE Grid which has bindings for all of the languages you are using.\n",

To make an applet, you have to write code, and there aren't any shortcuts.\nNow that flash etc have come along, you can pretty much just drap and drop your way through making a cool animation for your website. This is a much lower barrier for entry - you don't have to know how to program in order to get a flash animation working. So flash proliferates, and java applets are hardly used anymore.\n",

Microsoft said the decision to include the JVM this week is a direct result of the latest legal entanglement with Sun, but Microsoft plans to disband support for Java in Windows following Jan. 1, 2004.

        "For example, let's say I have an application that can read in a CSV file with piles of data rows.  I give the user a summary of the number of rows based on types of data, but I want to make sure that I don't read in too many rows of data and cause OutOfMemoryErrors.  Each row translates into an object.  Is there an easy way to find out the size of that object programmatically?  Is there a reference that defines how large primitive types and object references are for a VM?\nRight now, I have code that says read up to 32,000 rows, but I'd also like to have code that says read as many rows as possible until I've used 32MB of memory.  Maybe that is a different question, but I'd still like to know. \n", 
        "I doubt you want to do it programmatically unless you just want to do it once and store it for future use.  It's a costly thing to do.  There's no sizeof() operator in Java, and even if there was, it would only count the cost of the references to other objects and the size of the primitives.\nOne way you could do it is to serialize the thing to a File and look at the size of the file, like this:\n\nOf course, this assumes that each object is distinct and doesn't contain non-transient references to anything else.\nAnother strategy would be to take each object and examine its members by reflection and add up the sizes (boolean & byte = 1 byte, short & char = 2 bytes, etc.), working your way down the membership hierarchy.  But that's tedious and expensive and ends up doing the same thing the serialization strategy would do.\n", 
        "There isn't a method call, if that's what you're asking for. With a little research, I suppose you could write your own. A particular instance has a fixed sized derived from the number of references and primitive values plus instance bookkeeping data. You would simply walk the object graph. The less varied the row types, the easier.\nIf that's too slow or just more trouble than it's worth, there's always good old-fashioned  row counting rule-of-thumbs.\n", 
        "If you would just like to know how much memory is being used in your JVM, and how much is free, you could try something like this:\n\nedit: I thought this might be helpful as the question author also stated he would like to have logic that handles \"read as many rows as possible until I've used 32MB of memory.\"\n", 
        "You have to walk the objects using reflection.  Be careful as you do:\n\nJust allocating an object has some overhead in the JVM.  The amount varies by JVM so you might make this value a parameter.  At least make it a constant (8 bytes?) and apply to anything allocated.\nJust because byte is theoretically 1 byte doesn't mean it takes just one in memory.\nThere will be loops in object references, so you'll need to keep a HashMap or somesuch using object-equals as the comparator to eliminate infinite loops.\n\n@jodonnell: I like the simplicity of your solution, but many objects aren't Serializable (so this would throw an exception), fields can be transient, and objects can override the standard methods.\n", 
        "You have to measure it with a tool, or estimate it by hand, and it depends on the JVM you are using.\nThere is some fixed overhead per object. It's JVM-specific, but I usually estimate 40 bytes. Then you have to look at the members of the class. Object references are 4 (8) bytes in a 32-bit (64-bit) JVM. Primitive types are: \n\nboolean and byte: 1 byte\nchar and short: 2 bytes\nint and float: 4 bytes\nlong and double: 8 bytes\n\nArrays follow the same rules; that is, it's an object reference so that takes 4 (or 8) bytes in your object, and then its length multiplied by the size of its element.\nTrying to do it programmatically with calls to Runtime.freeMemory() just doesn't give you much accuracy, because of asynchronous calls to the garbage collector, etc. Profiling the heap with -Xrunhprof or other tools will give you the most accurate results.\n", 
        "Firstly \"the size of an object\" isn't a well-defined concept in Java. You could mean the object itself, with just its members, the Object and all objects it refers to (the reference graph). You could mean the size in memory or the size on disk. And the JVM is allowed to optimise things like Strings.\nSo the only correct way is to ask the JVM, which a good profiler (I use YourKit), which probably isn't what you want.\nHowever, from the description above it sounds like each row will be self-contained, and not have a big dependency tree, so the serialization method will probably be a good approximation on most JVMs. The easiest way to do this is as follows:\n\nRemember that if you have objects with common references this will not give the correct result, and size of serialization will not always match size in memory, but it is a good approximation. The code will be a bit more efficient if you initialise the ByteArrayOutputStream size to a sensible value.\n", 
        "Some years back Javaworld had an article on determining the size of composite and potentially nested Java objects, they basically walk through creating a sizeof() implementation in Java. The approach basically builds on other work where people experimentally identified the size of primitives and typical Java objects and then apply that knowledge to a method that recursively walks an object graph to tally the total size.\nIt is always going to be somewhat less accurate than a native C implementation simply because of the things going on behind the scenes of a class but it should be a good indicator.\nAlternatively a SourceForge project appropriately called sizeof that offers a Java5 library with a sizeof() implementation.\nP.S. Do not use the serialization approach, there is no correlation between the size of a serialized object and the amount of memory it consumes when live.\n",

You are not trying to read the whole image from S3, buffer it in memory, then sending the whole thing at once?  \nIf you use 8K buffers, you could have 1000 concurrent streams going in ~8Megs of heap space, so you are definitely doing something wrong....\nBTW, I did not pick 8K out of thin air, it is the default size for socket buffers, send more data, say 1Meg, and you will be blocking on the tcp/ip stack holding a large amount of memory.\n",

Let's say your JVM has 256MB of \"extra\" memory to use for serving image data.  With Google's help, \"256MB / 200KB\" = 1310.  For 2GB \"extra\" memory (these days a very reasonable amount) over 10,000 simultaneous clients could be supported.  Even so, 1300 simultaneous clients is a pretty large number.  Is this the type of load you experienced?  If not, you may need to look elsewhere for the cause of the OOM exception.\nEdit - Regarding:\n\nIn this use case the images can contain sensitive data...\n\nWhen I read through the S3 documentation a few weeks ago, I noticed that you can generate time-expiring keys that can be attached to S3 URLs.  So, you would not have to open up the files on S3 to the public.  My understanding of the technique is:\n\nInitial HTML page has download links to your webapp\nUser clicks on a download link\nYour webapp generates an S3 URL that includes a key that expires in, lets say, 5 minutes.\nSend an HTTP redirect to the client with the URL from step 3.\nThe user downloads the file from S3.  This works even if the download takes more than 5 minutes - once a download starts it can continue through completion.\n\n",

        "I'm returning to c++ after being away for a bit and trying to dust off the old melon. \nIn Java Iterator is an interface to a container having methods: hasNext(), next() and remove(). The presence of hasNext() means it has the concept of a limit for the container being traversed.\n\nIn the C++ standard template library, iterators seem to represent a datatype or class the supports the operator++ and operator== but has no concept of a limit built in so comparison is required before advancing to the next item. The limit has to checked by the user comparing two iterators in the normal case the second iterator is the container end.\n\nThe interesting part here is that in C++ a pointer is an iterator to an array. The STL took what was existing and build convention around it.\nIt there any further subtlety to this that I am missing?\n", 
        "Yes, there is a large conceptual difference. C++ utilizes different \"classes\" of iterators. Some are used for random access (unlike Java), some are used for forward access (like java). While even others are used for writing data (for use with, say, transform). \nSee the iterators concept in the C++ Documentation:\n\nInput Iterator\nOutput Iterator\nForward Iterator\nBidirectional Iterator\nRandom Access Iterator\n\nThese are far more interesting and powerful compared to Java/C#'s puny iterators. Hopefully these conventions will be codified using C++0x's Concepts.\n", 
        "Iterators are only equivalent to pointers in the trivial case of iterating over the contents of an array in sequence. An iterator could be supplying objects from any number of other sources: from a database, from a file, from the network, from some other calculation, etc.\n", 
        "A pointer to an array element is indeed an iterator into the array.\nAs you say, in Java, an iterator has more knowledge of the underlying container than in C++. C++ iterators are general, and a pair of iterators can denote any range: this can be a sub-range of a container, a range over multiple containers (see http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/articles/pair_iterators.pdf or http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/iterator/doc/zip_iterator.html) or even a range of numbers (see http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/iterator/doc/counting_iterator.html)\nThe iterator categories identify what you can and can't do with a given iterator.\n", 
        "Perhaps a bit more theoretical. Mathematically, collections in C++ can be described as a half-open interval of iterators, namely one iterator pointing to the start of the collection and one iterator pointing just behind the last element.\nThis convention opens up a host of possibilities. The way algorithms work in C++, they can all be applied to subsequences of a larger collection. To make such a thing work in Java, you have to create a wrapper around an existing collection that returns a different iterator.\nAnother important aspect of iterators has already been mentioned by Frank. There are different concepts of iterators. Java iterators correspond to C++' input iterators, i.e. they are read-only iterators that can only be incremented one step at a time and can't go backwards.\nOn the other extreme, you have C pointers which correspond exactly to C++' concept of a random access iterator.\nAll in all, C++ offers a much richer and purer concept that can be applied to a much wider variety of tasks than either C pointers or Java iterators.\n", 
        "C++ library (the part formerly known as STL) iterators are designed to be compatible with pointers. Java, without pointer arithmetic, had the freedom to be more programmer-friendly.\nIn C++ you end up having to use a pair of iterators. In Java you either use an iterator or a collection. Iterators are supposed to be the glue between algorithm and data structure. Code written for 1.5+ rarely need mention iterators, unless it is implementing a particular algorithm or data structure (which the vary majority of programmers have no need to do). As Java goes for dynamic polymorphism subsets and the like are much easier to handle.\n", 
        "To me the fundamental difference is that Java Iterators point between items, whereas C++ STL iterators point at items.\n", 
        "C++ iterators are a generalization of the pointer concept; they make it applicable to a wider range of situations.  It means that they can be used to do such things as define arbitrary ranges.\nJava iterators are relatively dumb enumerators (though not so bad as C#'s; at least Java has ListIterator and can be used to mutate the collection).\n", 
        "As mentioned, Java and C# iterators describe an intermixed position(state)-and-range(value), while C++ iterators separate the concepts of position and range.  C++ iterators represent 'where am I now' separately from 'where can I go?'.\nJava and C# iterators can't be copied.  You can't recover a previous position.  The common C++ iterators can.\nConsider this example:\n\nClick the above link to see program output.\nThis rather silly loop goes through a sequence (using forward iterator semantics only), printing each contiguous subsequence of 3 elements exactly once (and a couple shorter subsequences at the end).  But supposing N elements, and M elements per line instead of 3, this algorithm would still be O(N*M) iterator increments, and O(1) space.\nThe Java style iterators lack the ability to store position independently.  You will either\n\nlose O(1) space, using (for example) an array of size M to store history as you iterate\nwill need to traverse the list N times, making O(N^2+N*M) time\nor use a concrete Array type with GetAt member function, losing genericism and the ability to use linked list container types.\n\nSince only forward iteration mechanics were used in this example, i was able to swap in a list with no problems.  This is critical to authoring generic algorithms, such as search, delayed initialization and evaluation, sorting, etc.\nThe inability to retain state corresponds most closely to the C++ STL input iterator, on which very few algorithms are built.  \n",

Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks. We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests. Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. \nSo far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it staticInit. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock staticInit with JMockit to not do anything. Let's see this in example.\n\nWill be changed to\n\nSo that we can do the following in a JUnit.\n\nHowever this solution also comes with its own problems.

It sounds like you've already done a little refactoring with your staticInit() function, but maybe that function needs to be called from the constructor, not from a static initializer.  If you can do away with static initializers period, you will be better off.  Only you can make this decision (I can't see your codebase) but some refactoring will definitely help.\nAs for mocking, I use EasyMock, but I have run into the same issue.  Side effects of static initializers in legacy code make testing difficult.  Our answer was to refactor out the static initializer.\n", 
        "I suppose you really want some kind of factory instead of the static initializer.\nSome mix of a singleton and an abstract factory would probably be able to get you the same functionality as today, and with good testability, but that would add quite a lot of boiler-plate code, so it might be better to just try to refactor the static stuff away completely or if you could at least get away with some less complex solution. \nHard to tell if it\u00b4s possible without seeing your code though.\n",

On top of this, I make sure that the method can be invoked multiple times without problems (otherwise it is no better than the static initializer as far as the tests go).\nThis works reasonably well, and I can actually test that the static initializer method does what I expect/want it to do.  Sometimes it is just easiest to have some static initialization code, and it just isn't worth it to build an overly complex system to replace it.\nWhen I use this mechanism, I make sure to document that the protected method is only exposed for testing purposes, with the hopes that it won't be used by other developers.  This of course may not be a viable solution, for example if the class' interface is externally visible (either as a sub-component of some kind for other teams, or as a public framework).  It is a simple solution to the problem though, and doesn't require a third party library to set up (which I like).\n",

        "This is going to get into more \"Advanced\" JMockit. It turns out, you can redefine static initialization blocks in JMockit by creating a public void $clinit() method.

AFAIK, there is still no support for WPF, WCF, WF, of WIF. Mono can run on iOS, but to my knowledge, the Java runtime still runs on far more platforms than Mono.  Also, Mono is starting to see some much improved tooling (Xamarin), and Microsoft seems to have a much more cross-platform kind of attitude and willingness to work with partners to make them complimentary, rather than competitive (for example, Mono will be a pretty important part of the upcoming OWIN/Helios ASP.NET landscape).

While the frameworks do a great job of abstracting away what OS you are running on, little things like Linux's case sensitivity in paths and file names takes a bit of getting used to, as do things like permissions.\n.NET is definitely very cross platform due to Mono based on my experiences so far.\n",

        "I would vote for Java being more portable than C#.  Java definitely also has a very rich set of standard libraries.  There is also a broad set of open source 3rd party libraries out there such as those provided by the Jakarta project (http://jakarta.apache.org/).\nAll the usual suspects exist for CI, Unit testing, etc too.  Cross platform IDE support is also very good with the likes of Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ IDEA etc.\n", 
        "To add a bit more to the conversation, Java is more portable if you remain about one version behind - Java 5 still has many excellent features so you can wait for Java 6 and still have a lot of range in terms of language and libraries to develop with.  The Mac is the primary platform that can take some time to catch up to the latest Java version.\nJava also has an excellent standards body that intelligently grows the platform based on input from many different companies.  This is an oft overlooked feature but it keeps even new features working well across multiple platforms and provides a lot of range in library support for some esoteric things (as optional extensions).\n", 
        "I've been asking the same question off-late and IMHO, .NET/Mono seems to be a better option simply because Mono has a great track record for cross-platform desktop applications (as opposed to Java) and of course, Mono is improving by leaps and bounds these days.\n", 
        "I think the answer is \"it depends.\"  Java runs on just about anything, but .NET/Mono are (IMHO) a better framework for the desktop.  So I guess the answer really depends on what platforms you plan on targeting.\n", 
        "While Mono has its share of problems I think it has a better cross-platform compatibility story especially IF you have reliance on native platform invocation.\nThere are not enough words on Stack Overflow to stress how much smoother it is to get something native called and executed in .NET/Mono on (at least in my experience 3...) multiple platforms vs. the equivalent Java effort.\n", 
        "C# and Java allow almost any character in class names, method names, local variables, etc..  Is it bad practice to use non-ASCII characters, testing the boundaries of poor editors and analysis tools and making it difficult for some people to read, or is American arrogance the only argument against?\n", 
        "I'd say it entirely depends on who's working on the codebase.\nIf you have a small group of developers who all share a common language and you don't ever plan needing anyone who doesn't speak the language to work on the code then go ahead and use whatever characters you want.\nIf you need to have people of varying cultures and languages working on the code then it's probably best to stick with English since it's the common denominator for just about everyone in the world.\n", 
        "Part of the problem is that the Java/C# language and its libraries are based on English words like if and toString(). I personally would not like to switch between non-English language and English while reading code.\nHowever, if your database, UI, business logics (including metaphors) are already in some non-English language, there's no need to translate every method names and variables into English.\n", 
        "It depends:\n\nDoes your team conform to any existing standards that require your using ASCII?\nIs your code ever going to be feasibly reused or read by someone who doesn't speak your native language?\nDo you envision a scenario where you'll need to ask for help online and will therefore not be able to copy-paste your code sample in as-is?\nAre you certain your entire suite of tools support code encoding?\n\nIf you answered 'yes' to any of the above, stay ASCII only.  If not, go forward at your own risk.\n", 
        "I would stick to english, simply because you usually never know who is working on that code, and because some third-party tools used in the build/testing/bugtracking progress may have problems. Typing \u00e4\u00f6\u00fc\u00df on a Non-German Keyboard is simply a PITA, and I simply believe that anyone involved in software development should speak english, but maybe that's just my arrogance as a non-native-english speaker.\nWhat you call \"American arrogance\" is not whether or not your program uses international variable names, it's when your program thinks \"W\u00e4hrung\" and \"Wahrung\" are the same words.\n", 
        "IF you get past the other prerequisites you then have one extra (IMHO more important) one - How difficult is the symbol to type.\nOn my regular en-us keyboard, the only way I know of to type the letter \u00e7 is to hold alt, and hit 0227 on the numeric keypad, or copy and paste.\nThis would be a HUGE big roadblock in the way of typing quickly. You don't want to slow your coding down with trivial stuff like this if you aren't forced to. International keyboards may alleviate this, but then what happens if you have to code on your laptop which doesn't have an international keyboard, etc?\n", 
        "I used to work in a development team that happily wiped their asses with any naming (and for that matter any other coding) conventions. Believe it or not, having to cope with \u00e4's and \u00f6's in the code was a contributing factor of me resigning. Though I'm Finnish, I prefer writing code with US keyboard settings because curly and square brackets are a pain to write in a Finnish keyboard (try right alt and 7 and 0 for curlies).\nSo I say stick with the ascii characters.\n", 
        "If your business are non-English speakers, and you think Domain Driven Design has something to it, then there is another aspect: How do we, as developers, use the same domain language as our business without any translation overhead?\nThat does not only mean translations between languages, say English and Norwegian, but also between different words. We should use the exact same words as our business for our entity classes and services.\nI have found it easier to just give in and use my native language. Now that my code use the same words, it's easier to have a conversation with my domain experts.

Is there an easy, cross-platform way to detect 'crashes' in Java and to do something in response?\nI guess by 'crashes' I mean uncaught exceptions. However the code does use some JNI so it'd be nice to be able to catch crashes from bad JNI code, but I have a feeling that's JVM specific.\n", 
        "For handling uncaught exceptions you can provide a new ThreadGroup which provides an implementation of ThreadGroup.uncaughtException(...). You can then catch any uncaught exceptions and handle them appropriately (e.g. send a crash log home).\nI can't help you on the JNI front, there's probably a way using a native wrapper executable before calling the JVM, but that executable is going to need to know about all the possible JVMs it could be calling and how the indicate crashes and where crash logs are placed etc.\n", 
        "Not sure if this is what you needing, but you can also detect if an exception has occurred from within your native code.  See http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/functions.html#wp5234 for more info.\n",

I would reserve this kind of generalized crash handling for totally unrecoverable situations (i.e. subclasses of java.lang.Error).

(If you need them to be mutable but only until they're added to a Graph, you could enforce this by having an isInGraph flag on your Node/Edge classes that is set to true by Graph.Add{Node, Edge}, and have your mutators throw an exception if called after this flag is set.)\nI agree with jhkiley that passing Node objects to the Edge constructor (instead of Strings) sounds like a good idea.\nIf you want a more intrusive approach, you could have a pointer from the Node class back to the Graph it resides in, and update the Graph if any critical properties (e.g., the name) of the Node ever change.

In the rare case you have complete freedom and you're familiar with both languages, do some comparisons with the tools you have at your disposal.  That is really the only way to determine what's best.\n",

        "I have a web application that receives messages through an HTTP interface, e.g.:\n\nThis request contains the ID of the sender, the ID of the recipient and the text of the message.\nThis message should be processed like:\n\nfinding the matching User object for both the source and the destination from the database\ncreating a tree of objects: a Message that contains a field for the message text and two User objects for the source and the destination\npersisting this tree to a database.\n\nThe tree will be loaded by other applications that I can't touch.\nI use Oracle as the backing database and JPA with Toplink for the database handling tasks. If possible, I'd stay with these.\nWithout much optimization I can achieve ~30 requests/sec throughput in my environment. That's not much, I'd require ~300 requests/sec. So I measured where the performance bottleneck is and found that the calls to em.persist() takes most of the time. If I simply comment out that line, the throughput go well over 1000 requests/sec.\nI tried to write a small test application that used simple JDBC calls to persist 1 million messages to the same database. I used batching, meaning I did 100 inserts then a commit, and repeated until all the records was in the database. I measured ~500 requests/sec throughput in this scenario, that would meet my needs.\nIt is clear that I need to optimize insert performance here. However as I mentioned earlier I would like to keep using JPA and Toplink for this, not pure JDBC.\nDo you know a way to create batch inserts with JPA and Toplink? Can you recommend any other technique for improving JPA persist performance?\nADDITIONAL INFO:\n\"requests/sec\" means here: total number of requests / total time from beginning of test to last record written to database.\nI tried to make the calls to em.persist() asynchronous by creating an in-memory queue between the servlet stuff and the persister. It helped the performance greatly. However the queue did grow really fast and as the application will receive ~200 requests/second continuously, It is not an acceptable solution for me.\nIn this decoupled approach I collected requests for 100 msec and called em.persist() on all collected items before commiting the transaction. The EntityManagerFactory is cached between each transaction.\n",

Are you creating EntityManagerFactory objects with each request?\n", 
        "You should decouple from the JPA interface and use the bare TopLink API. You can probably chuck the objects you're persisting into a UnitOfWork and commit the UnitOfWork on your schedule (sync or async). Note that one of the costs of em.persist() is the implicit clone that happens of the whole object graph. TopLink will work rather better if you uow.registerObject() your two user objects yourself, saving itself the identity tests it has to otherwise do. So you'll end up with:\n\nThis is very old school TopLink btw ;)\nNote that the batch will help a lot, because batch writing and more especially batch writing with parameter binding will kick in which for this simple example will probably have a very large impact on your performance.\nOther things to look for: your sequencing size. A lot of the time spent writing objects in TopLink is actually spent reading sequencing information from the database, especially with the small defaults (I would probably have several hundred or even more as my sequence size).\n",

By tinkering with the HTTP response (which I obtained with WireShark), I observed that the .NET proxy class correctly picked up the MyResponse values if I forced the xmlns attribute on every returned data element.\nShort of changing the service, which I don't control, the workaround is to edit the VS generated proxy class (eg Reference.cs) and look for lines like this:\n\nand comment out the XmlType attribute line.

To really crash a VM there are 3 ways:\n\nUse JNI and crash in the native code.\nIf no security manager is installed you can use reflection to crash the VM. This is VM specific, but normally a VM stores a bunch of pointers to native resources in private fields (e.g. a pointer to the native thread object is stored in a long field in java.lang.Thread). Just change them via reflection and the VM will crash sooner or later.\nAll VMs have bugs, so you just have to trigger one.\n\nFor the last method I have a short example, which will crash a Sun Hotspot VM quiet nicely:\n\nThis leads to a stack overflow in the GC so you will get no StackOverflowError but a real crash including a hs_err* file.\n",

This the whole point of managed code.\nTypical crashes in native code happen by de-referencing pointers to wrong memory areas (null address or missaligned). Another source could be illegal machine instructions (opcodes) or unhandled signals from library or kernel calls. Both can be triggered if the JVM or the system libraries have bugs.\nFor example JITed (generated) code, native methods or system calls (graphics driver) can have problems leading to real crashes (it was quite common to get a crash when you used ZIP functions and they ran out of memory). In those cases the crash handler of the JVM kicks in and dumps the state. It could also generate a OS core file (Dr. Watson on Windows and core dump on *nix).\nOn Linux/Unix you can easyly make a JVM crash by sending it a Signal to the running process. Note: you should not use SIGSEGV for this, since Hotspot catches this signal and re-throws it as a NullPointerException in most places. So it is better to send a SIGBUS for example.\n",

        "Every programming language has its own set of rules and conventions for the kinds of names that you're allowed to use, and the Java programming language is no different. The rules and conventions for naming your variables can be summarized as follows:\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. A variable's name can be any legal identifier \u2014 an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign \"$\", or the underscore character \"_\". The convention, however, is to always begin your variable names with a letter, not \"$\" or \"_\". Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention, is never used at all. You may find some situations where auto-generated names will contain the dollar sign, but your variable names should always avoid using it. A similar convention exists for the underscore character; while it's technically legal to begin your variable's name with \"_\", this practice is discouraged. White space is not permitted.\nSubsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters. Conventions (and common sense) apply to this rule as well. When choosing a name for your variables, use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations. Doing so will make your code easier to read and understand. In many cases it will also make your code self-documenting; fields named cadence, speed, and gear, for example, are much more intuitive than abbreviated versions, such as s, c, and g. Also keep in mind that the name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.\nIf the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention. If your variable stores a constant value, such as static final int NUM_GEARS = 6, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere. \n\nFrom the official Java Tutorial\n",

I would have at a minimum one class of \"Settings\", or \"Values\", or \"Constants\", where all the constants would live.  If I have a large number of them, I'd group them up in logical constant classes (UserSettings, AppSettings, etc.)\n", 
        "That's the right way to go.\nGenerally constants are not kept in separate \"Constants\" classes because they're not discoverable.  If the constant is relevant to the current class, keeping them there helps the next developer.\n", 
        "Just avoid using an interface:\n\nIt is tempting, but violates encapsulation and blurs the distinction of class definitions.\n", 
        "To take it a step further, you can place globally used constants in an interface so they can be used system wide.  E.g.\n\nBut don't then implement it.  Just refer to them directly in code via the fully qualified classname.\n", 
        "What about an enumeration?\n", 
        "I would highly advise against having a single constants class.  It may seem a good idea at the time, but when developers refuse to document constants and the class grows to encompass upwards of 500 constants which are all not related to each other at all (being related to entirely different aspects of the application), this generally turns into the constants file being completely unreadable.  Instead:\n\nIf you have access to Java 5+, use enums to define your specific constants for an application area.  All parts of the application area should refer to enums, not constant values, for these constants.  You may declare an enum similar to how you declare a class.  Enums are perhaps the most (and, arguably, only) useful feature of Java 5+.\nIf you have constants that are only valid to a particular class or one of its subclasses, declare them as either protected or public and place them on the top class in the hierarchy.  This way, the subclasses can access these constant values (and if other classes access them via public, the constants aren't only valid to a particular class...which means that the external classes using this constant may be too tightly coupled to the class containing the constant)\nIf you have an interface with behavior defined, but returned values or argument values should be particular, it is perfectly acceptible to define constants on that interface so that other implementors will have access to them.  However, avoid creating an interface just to hold constants: it can become just as bad as a class created just to hold constants.\n\n", 
        "It is a BAD PRACTICE to use interfaces just to hold constants (named constant interface pattern by Josh Bloch). Here's what Josh advises:\n\nIf the constants are strongly tied to\n  an existing class or interface, you\n  should add them to the class or\n  interface. For example, all of the\n  boxed numerical primitive classes,\n  such as Integer and Double, export\n  MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE constants. If\n  the constants are best viewed as\n  members of an enumerated type, you\n  should export them with an enum\n  type. Otherwise, you should export the\n  constants with a noninstantiable\n  utility class.\n\nExample:\n\nAbout the naming convention:\n\nBy convention, such fields have names\n  consisting of capital letters, with\n  words separated by underscores. It is\n  critical that these fields contain\n  either primitive values or references\n  to immutable objects.\n\n", 
        "In Effective Java (2nd edition), it's recommended that you use enums instead of static ints for constants.\nThere's a good writeup on enums in Java here:\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html\nNote that at the end of that article the question posed is:\n\nSo when should you use enums?\n\nWith an answer of:\n\nAny time you need a fixed set of constants\n\n", 
        "I agree that using an interface is not the way to go. Avoiding this pattern even has its own item (#18) in Bloch's Effective Java.\nAn argument Bloch makes against the constant interface pattern is that use of constants is an implementation detail, but implementing an interface to use them exposes that implementation detail in your exported API.\nThe public|private static final TYPE NAME = VALUE; pattern is a good way of declaring a constant. Personally, I think it's better to avoid making a separate class to house all of your constants, but I've never seen a reason not to do this, other than personal preference and style.\nIf your constants can be well-modeled as an enumeration, consider the enum structure available in 1.5 or later.\nIf you're using a version earlier than 1.5, you can still pull off typesafe enumerations by using normal Java classes. (See this site for more on that).\n", 
        "The number one mistake you can make is creating a globally accessible class called with a generic name, like Constants. This simply gets littered with garbage and you lose all ability to figure out what portion of your system uses these constants.\nInstead, constants should go into the class which \"owns\" them. Do you have a constant called TIMEOUT? It should probably go into your Communications() or Connection() class. MAX_BAD_LOGINS_PER_HOUR? Goes into User().  And so on and so forth. \nThe other possible use is Java .properties files when \"constants\" can be defined at run-time, but not easily user changeable. You can package these up in your .jars and reference them with the Class resourceLoader.\n", 
        "For Constants, Enum is a better choice IMHO. Here is an example\npublic class myClass  {\n\n", 
        "A Constant, of any type, can be declared by creating an immutable property that within a class (that is a member variable with the final modifier).  Typically the static and  public modifiers are also provided.\n\nThere are numerous applications where a constant's value indicates a selection from an n-tuple (e.g. enumeration) of choices.  In our example, we can choose to define an Enumerated Type that will restrict the possible assigned values (i.e. improved type-safety):\n\n", 
        "One of the way I do it is by creating a 'Global' class with the constant values and do a static import in the classes that need access to the constant.\n", 
        "A single, generic constants class is a bad idea. Constants should be grouped together with the class they're most logically related to.\nRather than using variables of any kind (especially enums), I would suggest that you use methods. Create a method with the same name as the variable and have it return the value you assigned to the variable. Now delete the variable and replace all references to it with calls to the method you just created. If you feel that the constant is generic enough that you shouldn't have to create an instance of the class just to use it, then make the constant method a class method.\n", 
        "A good object oriented design should not need many publicly available constants.  Most constants should be encapsulated in the class that needs them to do its job.   \n", 
        "I prefer to use getters rather than constants.  Those getters might return constant values, e.g. public int getMaxConnections() {return 10;}, but anything that needs the constant will go through a getter.\nOne benefit is that if your program outgrows the constant--you find that it needs to be configurable--you can just change how the getter returns the constant.\nThe other benefit is that in order to modify the constant you don't have to recompile everything that uses it.  When you reference a static final field, the value of that constant is compiled into any bytecode that references it.\n", 
        "FWIW, a timeout in seconds value should probably be a configuration setting (read in from a properties file or through injection as in Spring) and not a constant.\n", 
        "Creating static final constants in a separate class can get you into trouble.  The Java compiler will actually optimize this and place the actual value of the constant into any class that references it.\nIf you later change the 'Constants' class and you don't do a hard re-compile on other classes that reference that class, you will wind up with a combination of old and new values being used.\nInstead of thinking of these as constants, think of them as configuration parameters and create a class to manage them.  Have the values be non-final, and even consider using getters.  In the future, as you determine that some of these parameters actually should be configurable by the user or administrator, it will be much easier to do.\n",

(eg: if the container event is caused by adding a TextField, then add a focus listener that knows how to select all the text in a TextField, and so on.)

IF you are just reading a Zip file that doesn't have read-ahead zip entries embedded, then ZipInputStream isn't going to work for you.\nSome useful tidbits about the Zip format:\nEach file embedded in a zip file has a header.  This header can contain useful information (such as the compressed length of the stream, it's offset in the file, CRC) - or it can contain some magic values that basically say 'The information isn't in the stream header, you have to check the Zip post-amble'.\nEach zip file then has a table that is attached to the end of the file that contains all of the zip entries, along with the real data.  The table at the end is mandatory, and the values in it must be correct.  In contrast, the values embedded in the stream do not have to be provided.\nIf you use ZipFile, it reads the table at the end of the zip.  If you use ZipInputStream, I suspect that getNextEntry() attempts to use the entries embedded in the stream.  If those values aren't specified, then ZipInputStream has no idea how long the stream might be.  The inflate algorithm is self terminating (you actually don't need to know the uncompressed length of the output stream in order to fully recover the output), but it's possible that the Java version of this reader doesn't handle this situation very well.\nI will say that it's fairly unusual to have a servlet returning a ZipInputStream (it's much more common to receive an inflatorInputStream if you are going to be receiving compressed content.\n",

        "Java JVM (actually might change from different implementations of the JVM) when first started out will interpret the byte code. Once it detects that the code will be running enough number of times JITs it to native machine language so it runs faster. \n", 
        "Okay, I found where I read that.  This is all from \"Learning Java\" (O'Reilly 2005):\n\nThe problem with a traditional JIT compilation is that optimizing code takes time. So a JIT compiler can produce decent results but may suffer a significant latency when the application starts up. This is generally not a problem for long-running server-side applications but is a serious problem for client-side software and applications run on smaller devices with limited capabilities. To address this, Sun's compiler technology, called HotSpot, uses a trick called adaptive compilation. If you look at what programs actually spend their time doing, it turns out that they spend almost all their time executing a relatively small part of the code again and again. The chunk of code that is executed repeatedly may be only a small fraction of the total program, but its behavior determines the program's overall performance. Adaptive compilation also allows the Java runtime to take advantage of new kinds of optimizations that simply can't be done in a statically compiled language, hence the claim that Java code can run faster than C/C++ in some cases.\nTo take advantage of this fact, HotSpot starts out as a normal Java bytecode interpreter, but with a difference: it measures (profiles) the code as it is executing to see what parts are being executed repeatedly. Once it knows which parts of the code are crucial to performance, HotSpot compiles those sections into optimal native machine code. Since it compiles only a small portion of the program into machine code, it can afford to take the time necessary to optimize those portions. The rest of the program may not need to be compiled at all\u2014just interpreted\u2014saving memory and time. In fact, Sun's default Java VM can run in one of two modes: client and server, which tell it whether to emphasize quick startup time and memory conservation or flat out performance.\nA natural question to ask at this point is, Why throw away all this good profiling information each time an application shuts down? Well, Sun has partially broached this topic with the release of Java 5.0 through the use of shared, read-only classes that are stored persistently in an optimized form. This significantly reduces both the startup time and overhead of running many Java applications on a given machine. The technology for doing this is complex, but the idea is simple: optimize the parts of the program that need to go fast, and don't worry about the rest.\n\nI'm kind of wondering how far Sun has gotten with it since Java 5.0.\n", 
        "I agree that it's likely the result of disk caching.\nFYI, the IBM Java 6 VM does contain an ahead-of-time compiler (AOT).  The code isn't quite as optimized as what the JIT would produce, but it is stored across VMs, I believe in some sort of persistent shared memory.  Its primary benefit is to improve startup performance.  The IBM VM by default JITs a method after it's been called 1000 times.  If it knows that a method is going to be called 1000 times just during the VM startup (think a commonly-used method like java.lang.String.equals(...) ), then it's beneficial for it to store that in the AOT cache so that it never has to waste time compiling at runtime.\n", 
        "I agree that the performance difference seen by the poster is most likely caused by disk latency bringing the JRE into memory.  The Just In Time compiler (JIT) would not have an impact on performance of a little application.\nJava 1.6u10 (http://download.java.net/jdk6/) touches the runtime JARs in a background process (even if Java isn't running) to keep the data in the disk cache.  This significantly decreases startup times (Which is a huge benefit to desktop apps, but probably of marginal value to server side apps).\nOn large, long running applications, the JIT makes a big difference over time - but the amount of time required for the JIT to accumulate sufficient statistics to kick in and optimize (5-10 seconds) is very, very short compared to the overall life of the application (most run for months and months).  While storing and restoring the JIT results is an interesting academic exercise, the practical improvement is not very large (Which is why the JIT team has been more focused on things like GC strategies for minimizing memory cache misses, etc...).\nThe pre-compilation of the runtime classes does help desktop applications quite a bit (as does the aforementioned 6u10 disk cache pre-loading).\n", 
        "You should describe how your Benchmark was done. Especially at which point you start to measure the time. \nIf you include the JVM startup time (which is useful for Benchmarking the User experience but not so useful to optimize Java code) then it might be a filesystem caching effect or it can be caused by a feature called \"Java Class Data Sharing\":\nFor Sun:\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/vm/class-data-sharing.html\nThis is an option where the JVM saves a prepared image of the runtime classes to a file, to allow quicker loading (and sharing) of those at the next start. You can control this with -Xshare:on or -Xshare:off with a Sun JVM. The default is -Xshare:auto which will load the shared classes image if present, and if not present it will write it at first startup if the directory is write able.\nWith IBM Java 5 this is BTW even more powerful:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ibmjava4/\nI don't know of any mainstream JVM which is saving JIT statistics.\n",

        "Eclipse and NetBeans are both good options.  If you don't mind paying a little, so is IntelliJ IDEA (an academic license costs $99).\n", 
        "Java editing tends to go one of two ways; people either stick with a simple editor and use a terminal to compile/run their programs, or they use a big IDE with a zillion features.\nI usually go the simple route and just use a plain text editor and terminal, but there's still a lot to be said for IDEs.  This is especially true when learning the language, since hitting \"spam.\" brings up a dropdown with all of the fields and methods of the spam object.    And this is not just useful to a beginner; it remains useful later on when using unfamiliar libraries and third party modules.\nIDEs also have useful tools such as GUI builders which become invaluable when doing professional Java work.  So although I typically prefer a simple editor/terminal combo, I highly recommend trying out an IDE such as Eclipse or Netbeans to see how you like it and so that you'll know how to use one later on.\n", 
        "As far as IDEs go, I've found Eclipse to be about the best you could ask for. If you are used to IDEs full of features like VS, it should be right up your alley, and it isn't particularly resource-hungry; the way it organizes your projects makes the whole thing pretty simple as well, and it's also good to have on your resume. If you're looking for a non-intrusive IDE, mostly intuitive and that does its job as a great assistant, go with Eclipse. Not to mention its customization options.\nIf, on the other side, you'd like a much more light IDE, textPad-style (why?), I'd recommend Geany; I've worked with it in the past and it's got all the basic features to get started with the language and not be overwhelmed with all the features that big IDEs can offer. But I'd still recommend to go with Eclipse as soon as you get used to the language and need the IDE to be more of an assistant.\n", 
        "Another vote for Eclipse. In particular, you should be able to install it from within Ubuntu, as there are packages for it in one of the repositories (I forget which one specifically, as I'm not at my Ubuntu machine right this minute). If you use the GUI package-management application under the \"Admin\" menu, you should be able to find Eclipse and related packages.\n", 
        "I usually just use vim, but i've actually found the IDE Geany quite intuitive with a lot of good features but not really overblown. Check it out.\nEDIT: I don't think Geany is fit for enterprise-level programming, but for a quick program it's one of the better IDEs I've seen, especially if you've had bad experiences with NetBeans or Eclipse as I have.\n", 
        "I'd actually just recommend Eclipse. It seems bloated at first, but once you get used to it, you can use it to develop code very very quickly (and thus it's an excellent choice for a quick bit of Java).\nFeatures I like: \nControl+1 for error fixing - it knows how to fix most compile errors - just highlight the error in the code (which will be underlined in red) and it will give you a list of suggestions. Control+1 selects the first suggestion, which is almost always correct.\nYou can use this error fixing feature to write code that uses methods you haven't written yet - the error fixing will create the method on the class/interface you called it on, with the correct parameters/name/visibility etc. Or, if theres a similarly named method with similar parameters, it will suggest you've spelt it wrong when you called it.\nThe refactoring tools are also supergreat - you can highlight a block of code to extract as a method, and it'll work out what variables need to be passed in, and what it should return (if anything). You can move variables between field and methods. You can change class/interface/variable names, and it will correct them only where it needs to (which beats a search and replace any day).\nYou really don't need to know many eclipse features to get the benefit of using it - and it'll dramatically speed up your coding. I wish I'd known how to use it at University.\nBasically, I'd recommend Eclipse. The time saved coding will make up for having to click \"yes\" a couple times when you start a project..\n",

        "in our working enviroment we have to use the free Oracle JDeveloper ... sigh .. at home I tend to use Eclipse more and I really like it\n",

        "As many others, I suggest you to use Eclipse. It works fine in linux and after a few days you will find it not so unfriendly.\nMoreover, if you will start developing more complex programs in java, you already will be familiar with a standard, complete and open source IDE, which is also the foundation for many other professional IDE for other languages, like Adobe Flex Builder, Aptana Red Rails and so on.\n", 
        "My team is developing a new service oriented product with a web front-end.  In discussions about what technologies we will use we have settled on running a JBoss application server, and Flex frontend (with possible desktop deployment using Adobe AIR), and web services to interface the client and server.\nWe've reached an impasse when it comes to which server technology to use for our business logic.  The big argument is between EJB3 and Spring, with our biggest concerns being scalability and performance, and also maintainability of the code base.\nHere are my questions:\n\nWhat are the arguments for or against EJB3 vs Spring? \n\n\nWhat pitfalls can I expect with each?\nWhere can I find good benchmark information?\n\n\n", 
        "I would definitely recommend EJB3 over spring. We find that it's more streamlined, nicer to code in, and better supported. I have in the past used Spring and found it to be very confusing, and not as well documented as EJB3 (or JPA I guess at the end of the day)\n\nAs of EJB3 you no longer have to deal with external config files, and there's only one POJO that you annotate per database table. This POJO can be passed to your web tier without any problems. IDEs like Netbeans can even auto-generate these POJOs for you. We've used EJB3 now as the back end for quite a few large scale applications, and haven't noticed any performance problems.\nYour Session Beans can be easily exposed as web services which you could expose to your Flex frontend.\nSession beans are easy to lock down at either a method or class level to assign roles and things like that if you need to.\n\nI can't speak that much about spring, as I only tried it out for a few weeks. But my overall impression of it was very poor. That doesn't mean it's bad framework, but our team here has found EJB3 to be the best for the persistence/business layer.\n", 
        "What are the arguments for or against EJB3 vs Spring?\nSpring is always innovating and recognizes real-world constraints. Spring offered simplicity and elegance for the Java 1.4 application servers and didn't require a version of the J2EE specification that no one had access to in 2004 - 2006.  At this point it is almost a religious debate that you can get sucked into - Spring + abstraction + open-source versus Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) 5.0 specifications.  \nI think Spring complements more than competes  with the Java EE specifications. As the features that were once unique to Spring continue to get rolled into the specification, many will argue that EJB 3 offers a 'good enough' feature set for most internal business applications.\nWhat pitfalls can I expect with each?\nIf your treating this as persistence issue (Spring+JPA) versus EJB3 your really not making that big of a choice.\nWhere can I find good benchmark information?\nI haven't followed the specj benchmark results for sometime, but they were popular for a while.  It seems that each vendor (IBM, JBOSS, Oracle, and Sun) get less and less interested in having a compliant server.  The lists get Shorter and shorter of certified vendors as you go from 1.3, 1.4. 1.5 Java Enterprise Edition.  I think the days of a giant server that is fully compliant with all the specifications are over.\n", 
        "i have used a very similar architecture in the past. Spring + Java 1.5 + Actionscript 2/3 when combined with Flex Data Services made it all very easy (and fun!) to code. \nthough, a Flex front end means you need adequately powerful client machines.\n", 
        "There won't be much difference between EJB3 and Spring based on Performance. We chose Spring for the following reasons (not mentioned in the question):\n\nSpring drives the architecture in a direction that more readily supports unit testing. For example, inject a mock DAO object to unit test your business layer, or utilize Spring's MockHttpRequest object to unit test a servlet. We maintain a separate Spring config for unit tests that allows us to isolate tests to the specific layers.\nAn overriding driver was compatibility. If you need to support more than one App Server (or eventually want the option to move from JBoss to Glassfish, etc.), you will essentially be carrying your container (Spring) with you, rather than relying on compatibility between different implementations of the EJB3 specification.\nSpring allows for technology choices for Persistence, object remoting, etc. For example, we are also using a Flex front end, and are using the Hessian protocol for communications between Flex and Spring.\n\n", 
        "I tend to prefer Spring over EJB3 but my recommendation would be whichever approach you take, try to stick to writing POJOs and use the standard annotations where possible, like the JSR annotations such as @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy and @Resource which work with both EJB3 or Spring so you can pick whichever framework you prefer. \ne.g. you could decide on some project to use Guice instead for IoC.\nIf you want to use pre-request injection such as in a web application you might find Guice is quite a bit faster for dependency injection than Spring.\nSession beans mostly boil down to dependency injection and transactions; so EJB3 and Spring are kinda similar really for that. Where Spring has the edge is on better dependency injection and nicer abstractions for things like JMS\n", 
        "I have a large application that uses EJB 2.x entity beans (BMP). This is well-known to be a horrible persistence strategy (I can elaborate if necessary).\nI'd like to start migrating this application to use a much more expressive, transparent, and non-invasive persistence strategy, and given my company's previous experience with it, Hibernate 3.x is the obvious choice.\nMigrating to Hibernate is going to take a while, as over 100 tables in the application use entity beans. So I'm looking at a phased approach where the two persistence strategies run in parallel, ideally on the same tables at the same time, if possible.\nMy question is, what are the pitfalls (if any) of combining these two persistence strategies? Will they get in each other's way?\n", 
        "I guess the thing to really be careful with is working with the Hibernate sessions.  Hibernate caches stuff, and that might get in the way.\nFrankly I would recommend that if you adopt Hibernate, drop the Entity beans entirely.  Do your Hibernate work within session beans and let the session beans manage your transactions.\nOr alternately use EJB 3, which is Hibernate standardized into the Java Persistence API.\n", 
        "As said jodonnel, you have to pay attention to caching, because if you use second-level caching in Hibernate and a table is modified outside of Hibernate, then Hibernate has no way to know that its cache entry is stale.\nFor the transactions, they should both use JTA provided by the container, so for that it should be safe.\n",

        "What is the main difference between an inner class and a static nested class in Java? Does design / implementation play a role in choosing one of these?\n", 
        "Ummm... an inner class IS a nested class... do you mean anonymous class and inner class?\nEdit:  If you actually meant inner vs anonymous... an inner class is just a class defined within a class such as:\n\nWhereas an anonymous class is an extension of a class defined anonymously, so no actual \"class is defined, as in:\n\nFurther Edit:\nWikipedia claims there is a difference in Java, but I've been working with Java for 8 years, and it's the first I heard such a distinction... not to mention there are no references there to back up the claim... bottom line, an inner class is a class defined within a class (static or not), and nested is just another term to mean the same thing.\nThere is a subtle difference between static and non-static nested class... basically non-static inner classes have implicit access to instance fields and methods of the enclosing class (thus they cannot be constructed in a static context, it will be a compiler error).  Static nested classes, on the other hand, don't have implicit access to instance fields and methods, and CAN be constructed in a static context.\n", 
        "The terms are used interchangeably.  If you want to be really pedantic about it, then you could define \"nested class\" to refer to a static inner class, one which has no enclosing instance.  In code, you might have something like this:\n\nThat's not really a widely accepted definition though.\n", 
        "From the Java Tutorial:\n\nNested classes are divided into two categories: static and non-static. Nested classes that are declared static are simply called static nested classes. Non-static nested classes are called inner classes. \n\nStatic nested classes are accessed using the enclosing class name:\n\nFor example, to create an object for the static nested class, use this syntax:\n\nObjects that are instances of an inner class exist within an instance of the outer class. Consider the following classes:\n\nAn instance of InnerClass can exist only within an instance of OuterClass and has direct access to the methods and fields of its enclosing instance.\nTo instantiate an inner class, you must first instantiate the outer class. Then, create the inner object within the outer object with this syntax:\n\nsee: Java Tutorial - Nested Classes\nFor completeness note that there is also such a thing as an inner class without an enclosing instance:\n\nHere, new A() { ... } is an inner class defined in a static context and does not have an enclosing instance.\n", 
        "Nested class is a very general term: every class which is not top level is a nested class.\nAn inner class is a non-static nested class.\nJoseph Darcy wrote a very nice explanation about Nested, Inner, Member, and Top-Level Classes.\n", 
        "The instance of the inner class is created when instance of the outer class is created. Therefore the members and methods of the inner class have access to the members and methods of the instance (object) of the outer class. When the instance of the outer class goes out of scope, also the inner class instances cease to exist.\nThe static nested class doesn't have a concrete instance. It's just loaded when it's used for the first time (just like the static methods). It's a completely independent entity, whose methods and variables doesn't have any access to the instances of the outer class.\nThe static nested classes are not coupled with the outer object, they are faster, and they don't take heap/stack memory, because its not necessary to create instance of such class. Therefore the rule of thumb is to try to define static nested class, with as limited scope as possible (private >= class >= protected >= public), and then convert it to inner class (by removing \"static\" identifier) and loosen the scope, if it's really necessary.\n", 
        "I don't think the real difference became clear in the above answers. \nFirst to get the terms right: \n\nA nested class is a class which is contained in another class at the source code level.\nIt is static if you declare it with the static modifier.\nA non-static nested class is called inner class. (I stay with non-static nested class.)\n\nMartin's answer is right so far. However, the actual question is: What is the purpose of declaring a nested class static or not?\nYou use static nested classes if you just want to keep your classes together if they belong topically together or if the nested class is exclusively used in the enclosing class. There is no semantic difference between a static nested class and every other class.\nNon-static nested classes are a different beast. Similar to anonymous inner classes, such nested classes are actually closures. That means they capture their surrounding scope and their enclosing instance and make that accessible. Perhaps an example will clarify that. See this stub of a Container:\n\nIn this case you want to have a reference from a child item to the parent container. Using a non-static nested class, this works without some work. You can access the enclosing instance of Container with the syntax Container.this.\nMore hardcore explanations following:\nIf you look at the Java bytecodes the compiler generates for an (non-static) nested class it might become even clearer:\n\nAs you can see the compiler creates a hidden field Container this$0. This is set in the constructor which has an additional parameter of type Container to specify the enclosing instance. You can't see this parameter in the source but the compiler implicitly generates it for a nested class. \nMartin's example\n\nwould so be compiled to a call of something like (in bytecodes)\n\nFor the sake of completeness:\nAn anonymous class is a perfect example of a non-static nested class which just has no name associated with it and can't be referenced later.\n", 
        "The Java tutorial says:\n\nTerminology: Nested classes are\n  divided into two categories: static\n  and non-static. Nested classes that\n  are declared static are simply called\n  static nested classes. Non-static\n  nested classes are called inner\n  classes.\n\nIn common parlance, the terms \"nested\" and \"inner\" are used interchangeably by most programmers, but I'll use the correct term \"nested class\" which covers both inner and static.\nClasses can be nested ad infinitum, e.g. class A can contain class B which contains class C which contains class D, etc. However, more than one level of class nesting is rare, as it is generally bad design.\nThere are three reasons you might create a nested class:\n\norganization: sometimes it seems most sensible to sort a class into the namespace of another class, especially when it won't be used in any other context\naccess: nested classes have special access to the variables/fields of their containing classes (precisely which variables/fields depends on the kind of nested class, whether inner or static).\nconvenience: having to create a new file for every new type is bothersome, again, especially when the type will only be used in one context\n\nThere are four kinds of nested class in Java. In brief, they are:\n\nstatic class: declared as a static member of another class\ninner class: declared as an instance member of another class\nlocal inner class: declared inside an instance method of another class\nanonymous inner class: like a local inner class, but written as an expression which returns a one-off object\n\nLet me elaborate in more details.\n\nStatic Classes\nStatic classes are the easiest kind to understand because they have nothing to do with instances of the containing class.\nA static class is a class declared as a static member of another class. Just like other static members, such a class is really just a hanger on that uses the containing class as its namespace, e.g. the class Goat declared as a static member of class Rhino in the package pizza is known by the name pizza.Rhino.Goat.\n\nFrankly, static classes are a pretty worthless feature because classes are already divided into namespaces by packages. The only real conceivable reason to create a static class is that such a class has access to its containing class's private static members, but I find this to be a pretty lame justification for the static class feature to exist.\n\nInner Classes\nAn inner class is a class declared as a non-static member of another class:\n\nLike with a static class, the inner class is known as qualified by its containing class name, pizza.Rhino.Goat, but inside the containing class, it can be known by its simple name. However, every instance of an inner class is tied to a particular instance of its containing class: above, the Goat created in jerry, is implicitly tied to the Rhino instance this in jerry. Otherwise, we make the associated Rhino instance explicit when we instantiate Goat:\n\n(Notice you refer to the inner type as just Goat in the weird new syntax: Java infers the containing type from the rhino part. And, yes new rhino.Goat() would have made more sense to me too.)\nSo what does this gain us? Well, the inner class instance has access to the instance members of the containing class instance. These enclosing instance members are referred to inside the inner class via just their simple names, not via this (this in the inner class refers to the inner class instance, not the associated containing class instance): \n\nIn the inner class, you can refer to this of the containing class as Rhino.this, and you can use this to refer to its members, e.g. Rhino.this.barry.\n\nLocal Inner Classes\nA local inner class is a class declared in the body of a method. Such a class is only known within its containing method, so it can only be instantiated and have its members accessed within its containing method. The gain is that a local inner class instance is tied to and can access the final local variables of its containing method. When the instance uses a final local of its containing method, the variable retains the value it held at the time of the instance's creation, even if the variable has gone out of scope (this is effectively Java's crude, limited version of closures).\nBecause a local inner class is neither the member of a class or package, it is not declared with an access level. (Be clear, however, that its own members have access levels like in a normal class.)\nIf a local inner class is declared in an instance method, an instantiation of the inner class is tied to the instance held by the containing method's this at the time of the instance's creation, and so the containing class's instance members are accessible like in an instance inner class. A local inner class is instantiated simply via its name, e.g. local inner class Cat is instantiated as new Cat(), not new this.Cat() as you might expect.\n\nAnonymous Inner Classes\nAn anonymous inner class is a syntactically convenient way of writing a local inner class. Most commonly, a local inner class is instantiated at most just once each time its containing method is run. It would be nice, then, if we could combine the local inner class definition and its single instantiation into one convenient syntax form, and it would also be nice if we didn't have to think up a name for the class (the fewer unhelpful names your code contains, the better). An anonymous inner class allows both these things:\n\nThis is an expression returning a new instance of an unnamed class which extends ParentClassName. You cannot supply your own constructor; rather, one is implicitly supplied which simply calls the super constructor, so the arguments supplied must fit the super constructor. (If the parent contains multiple constructors, the \u201csimplest\u201d one is called, \u201csimplest\u201d as determined by a rather complex set of rules not worth bothering to learn in detail--just pay attention to what NetBeans or Eclipse tell you.)\nAlternatively, you can specify an interface to implement:\n\nSuch a declaration creates a new instance of an unnamed class which extends Object and implements InterfaceName. Again, you cannot supply your own constructor; in this case, Java implicitly supplies a no-arg, do-nothing constructor (so there will never be constructor arguments in this case).\nEven though you can't give an anonymous inner class a constructor, you can still do any setup you want using an initializer block (a {} block placed outside any method).\nBe clear that an anonymous inner class is simply a less flexible way of creating a local inner class with one instance. If you want a local inner class which implements multiple interfaces or which implements interfaces while extending some class other than Object or which specifies its own constructor, you're stuck creating a regular named local inner class.\n", 
        "So, I have willfully kept myself a Java n00b until recently, and my first real exposure brought about a minor shock: Java does not have C# style properties!\nOk, I can live with that. However, I can also swear that I have seen property getter/setter code in Java in one codebase, but I cannot remember where. How was that achieved? Is there a language extension for that? Is it related to NetBeans or something?\n",

        "There is a \"standard\" pattern for getters and setters in Java, called Bean properties. Basically any method starting with get, taking no arguments and returning a value, is a property getter for a property named as the rest of the method name (with a lowercased start letter). Likewise set creates a setter of a void method with a single argument.\nFor example:\n\nMost Java IDEs will generate these methods for you if you ask them (in Eclipse it's as simple as moving the cursor to a field and hitting ctrl-1, then selecting the option from the list).\nFor what it's worth, for readability you can actually use is and has in place of get for boolean-type properties too, as in:\n\n", 
        "Most IDEs for Java will automatically generate getter and setter code for you if you want them to. There are a number of different conventions, and an IDE like Eclipse will allow you to choose which one you want to use, and even let you define your own.\nEclipse even includes automated refactoring that will allow you to wrap a property up in a getter and setter and it will modify all the code that accesses the property directly, to make it use the getter and/or setter.\nOf course, Eclipse can only modify code that it knows about - any external dependencies you have could be broken by such a refactoring.\n",

        "JAVA doesn't support multiple Inheritence.\nYou can get it to implement multiple interfaces and some see this as a way round the problem. Personally I have yet to use multiple inheritence, so I can't really understand its appeal.\nNormally when someone suggests multiple inheritence within c# or JAVA its due to the fact that 'they could' in c++. Im a fan of 'just because you can doens't mean you should'. As c# & JAVA doesn't support it, why try and force it to do something it wasn't designed to do. This is not to say that there are unique cases where it is a valid technique to empoly, just the code can usually be refactored to not need it.\n", 
        "Use of composition instead of inheritance tends to be the way around this. This actually also helps a lot with testability, so it's good practice in general. \nIf you just want your type to \"behave\" like several other types, you can inherit from as many interfaces as you like, though; you can't \"borrow\" implementation details from these though, obviously.\n", 
        "Use interfaces. You can implement as many as you'd like. You can usually use some variant on the Composite Pattern (GoF) to be able to reuse implementation code if that's desirable.\n", 
        "I believe that the fundamental reason that Java doesn't support multiple inheritance is the same as C#; all objects are ultimately derived from Object and it's having multiple paths to the same base class is ambiguous for the compiler. Ambiguous == Bad, so the compiler doesn't allow it.\nInstead, you can simulate multiple inheritance through delegation. See this article for an example.\n", 
        "You can cheat it a little (and I stress a little) by using java.lang.reflect.Proxy instances. \nThis really just allows you to add extra interfaces and delegate their calls to another instance at runtime.\nAs someone who mentors and tutors new developers I would be horrified if somebody showed me code that did this. Reflection is one of those tools that you really need to understand and have a good understanding of Java before jumping in. I personally have only ever done this once, and it was to make some code I didn't have control over implement some interfaces some other code I had no control over was expecting (it was a quick hack so I didn't have to write and maintain too much glue code).\n",

Do you really need multiple implementation inheritance? I bet you don't, it's chock full of unpleasant consequences, unless you're an Eiffel programmer anyway. \n",

It's a bit like mixins, where the outer class is mixed-in to the inner class, but not as safe, as you can change the state of the outer class as well as use its methods.\nGilad Bracha (one of the main java language designers) wrote a paper discussing that.\nSo, suppose you want to share some methods for internal use between some unrelated classes (e.g, for string manipulation), you can create sub classes of them as inner classes of a class that has all the needed methods, and the sub classes could use methods both from their super classes and from the outer class.  \nAnyway, it's tricky for complex classes, and you could get most of the functionality using static imports (from java 5 on).

I feel that quite often singletons are abused because they're easy to understand by everybody, they're used as a mechanism for getting \"global\" data into an OO design and they are used because it is easy to circumvent object lifecycle management (or really thinking about how you can do A from inside B).

        "Depending on the usage, there are several \"correct\" answers.\nSince java5 the best way to do it is to use an enum:\n\nPre java5, the most simple case is:\n\nLet's go over the code. First, you want the class to be final. In this case, I've used the final keyword to let the users know it is final. Then you need to make the constructor private to prevent users to create their own Foo. Throwing an exception from the constructor prevents users to use reflection to create a second Foo. Then you create a private static final Foo field to hold the only instance, and a public static Foo getInstance() method to return it. The Java specification makes sure that the constructor is only called when the class is first used.\nWhen you have a very large object or heavy construction code AND also have other accessible static methods or fields that might be used before an instance is needed, then and only then you need to use lazy initialization.\nYou can use a private static class to load the instance. The code would then look like:\n\nSince the line private static final Foo INSTANCE = new Foo(); is only executed when the class FooLoader is actually used, this takes care of the lazy instantiation, and is it guaranteed to be thread safe.\nWhen you also want to be able to serialize your object you need to make sure that deserialization won't create a copy.\n\nThe method readResolve() will make sure the only instance will be returned, even when the object was serialized in a previous run of your program.\n", 
        "Sometimes a simple \"static Foo foo = new Foo();\" is not enough. Just think of some basic data insertion you want to do.\nOn the other hand you would have to synchronize any method that instantiates the singleton variable as such.

        "An inner interface has to be static in order to be accessed. The interface isn't associated with instances of the class, but with the class itself, so it would be accessed with Foo.Bar, like so:\n\nIn most ways, this isn't different from a static inner class.\n",

Unless you're running into some package collisions (there already is an interface called Bar in the same package as Foo) I think I'd make it it's own file. It could also be a design decision to enforce the logical connection between Foo and Bar. Perhaps the author intended Bar to only be used with Foo (though a static inner interface won't enforce this, just a logical connection)\n", 
        "Static means that any class part of the package(project) can acces it without using a pointer. This can be usefull or hindering depending on the situation.\nThe perfect example of the usefullnes of \"static\" methods is the Math class. All methods in Math are static. This means you don't have to go out of your way, make a new instance, declare variables and store them in even more variables, you can just enter your data and get a result.\nStatic isn't always that usefull. If you're doing case-comparison for instance, you might want to store data in several different ways. You can't create three static methods with identical signatures. You need 3 different instances, non-static, and then you can and compare, caus if it's static, the data won't change along with the input.\nStatic methods are good for one-time returns and quick calculations or easy obtained data.\n",

So, you can do:\n\nWithout the static, the above would fail to compile. The advantage to this is that you don't need a new source file just to declare the interface. It also visually associates the interface Bar to the class Foo since you have to write Foo.Bar and implies that the Foo class does something with instances of Foo.Bar.\nA description of class types in Java.\n", 
        "The static keyword in the above example is redundant (a nested interface is automatically \"static\") and can be removed with no effect on semantics; I would recommend it be removed. The same goes for \"public\" on interface methods and \"public final\" on interface fields - the modifiers are redundant and just add clutter to the source code.\nEither way, the developer is simply declaring an interface named Foo.Bar. There is no further association with the enclosing class, except that code which cannot access Foo will not be able to access Foo.Bar either. (From source code - bytecode or reflection can access Foo.Bar even if Foo is package-private!)\nIt is acceptable style to create a nested interface this way if you expect it to be used only from the outer class, so that you do not create a new top-level name. For example:\n\n",

        "The question has been answered, but one good reason to use a nested interface is if its function is directly related to the class it is in. A good example of this is a Listener. If you had a class Foo and you wanted other classes to be able to listen for events on it, you could declare an interface named FooListener, which is ok, but it would probably be more clear to declare a nested interface and have those other classes implement Foo.Listener (a nested class Foo.Event isn't bad along with this).\n",

        "In a multi-threaded application I'm working on, we occasionally see ConcurrentModificationExceptions on our Lists (which are mostly ArrayList, sometimes Vectors).  But there are other times when I think concurrent modifications are happening because iterating through the collection appears to be missing items, but no exceptions are thrown.  I know that the docs for ConcurrentModificationException says you can't rely on it, but how would I go about making sure I'm not concurrently modifying a List?  And is wrapping every access to the collection in a synchronized block the only way to prevent it?\nUpdate: Yes, I know about Collections.synchronizedCollection, but it doesn't guard against somebody modifying the collection while you're iterating through it.  I think at least some of my problem is happening when somebody adds something to a collection while I'm iterating through it.\nSecond Update  If somebody wants to combine the mention of the synchronizedCollection and cloning like Jason did with a mention of the java.util.concurrent and the apache collections frameworks like jacekfoo and Javamann did, I can accept an answer.\n", 
        "Check out java.util.concurrent for versions of the standard Collections classes that are engineered to handle concurrency better.\n", 
        "You could try using defensive copying so that modifications to one List don't affect others.\n", 
        "Yes you have to synchronize access to collections objects.\nAlternatively, you can use the synchronized wrappers around any existing object.  See Collections.synchronizedCollection(). For example:\n\nHowever all code needs to use the safe version, and even so iterating while another thread modifies will result in problems.\nTo solve the iteration problem, copy the list first.  Example:\n\nFor more optimized, thread-safe collections, also look at java.util.concurrent.\n", 
        "Collections.synchronizedList() will render a list nominally thread-safe and java.util.concurrent has more powerful features.\n", 
        "Usually you get a ConcurrentModificationException if you're trying to remove an element from a list whilst it's being iterated through.\nThe easiest way to test this is:\n\nI'm not sure how you'd get around it. You may have to implement your own thread-safe list, or you could create copies of the original list for writing and have a synchronized class that writes to the list.\n", 
        "Wrapping accesses to the collection in a synchronized block is the correct way to do this. Standard programming practice dictates the use of some sort of locking mechanism (semaphore, mutex, etc) when dealing with state that is shared across multiple threads.\nDepending on your use case however you can usually make some optimizations to only lock in certain cases. For example, if you have a collection that is frequently read but rarely written, then you can allow concurrent reads but enforce a lock whenever a write is in progress. Concurrent reads only cause conflicts if the collection is in the process of being modified.\n", 
        "ConcurrentModificationException is best-effort because what you're asking is a hard problem.   There's no good way to do this reliably without sacrificing performance besides proving that your access patterns do not concurrently modify the list.\nSynchronization would likely prevent concurrent modifications, and it may be what you resort to in the end, but it can end up being costly.  The best thing to do is probably to sit down and think for a while about your algorithm.  If you can't come up with a lock-free solution, then resort to synchronization.\n", 
        "Depending on your update frequency one of my favorites is the CopyOnWriteArrayList or CopyOnWriteArraySet. They create a new list/set on updates to avoid concurrent modification exception. \n",

If iterator detects that modCount changed it throws Concurrent modification exception. \nSynchronizing (via Collections.synchronizedXXX) won't do good since it does not guarantee iterator safety it only synchronizes writes and reads via put, get, set ...\nSee java.util.concurennt and apache collections framework (it has some classes that are optimized do work correctly in concurrent environment when there is more reads (that are unsynchronized) than writes - see FastHashMap. \n",

        "Your original question seems to be asking for an iterator that sees live updates to the underlying collection while remaining thread-safe. This is an incredibly expensive problem to solve in the general case, which is why none of the standard collection classes do it.\nThere are lots of ways of achieving partial solutions to the problem, and in your application, one of those may be sufficient.\nJason gives a specific way to achieve thread safety, and to avoid throwing a ConcurrentModificationException, but only at the expense of liveness.\nJavamann mentions two specific classes in the java.util.concurrent package that solve the same problem in a lock-free way, where scalability is critical. These only shipped with Java 5, but there have been various projects that backport the functionality of the package into earlier Java versions, including this one, though they won't have such good performance in earlier JREs.\nIf you are already using some of the Apache Commons libraries, then as jacekfoo points out, the apache collections framework contains some helpful classes.\nYou might also consider looking at the Google collections framework.\n",

        "In this case I think your best bet might be to write a custom classloader to handle all classloading in your application, and whenever an exception class is requested you return a class that wraps the requested exception class.

        "I assume you don't mean any Exception but rather any uncaught Exception.\nIf this is the case this article on the Sun Website has some ideas.  You need to wrap your top level method in a try-catch block and also do some extra work to handle other Threads.\n",

What I presume you are more inerested in are uncaught exceptions.  If you are catching the exceptions you should handle notifications there.\nIn a desktop app there are two places to worry about this, in the event-dispatch-thread (EDT) and outside of the EDT.  Globaly you can register a class implementing java.util.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler and register it via java.util.Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler.  This will get called if an exception winds down to the bottom of the stack and the thread hasn't had a handler set on the current thread instance on the thread or the ThreadGroup.\nThe EDT has a different hook for handling exceptions.  A system property 'sun.awt.exception.handler' needs to be registerd with the Fully Qualified Class Name of a class with a zero argument constructor.  This class needs an instance method handle(Throwable) that does your work.  The return type doesn't matter, and since a new instance is created every time, don't count on keeping state.\nSo if you don't care what thread the exception occurred in a sample may look like this:\n\nAdd this class into some random package, and then call the registerExceptionHandler method and you should be ready to go.\n",

The API states:\n\nThis transaction manager is appropriate for applications that use a single JPA EntityManagerFactory for transactional data access. JTA (usually through JtaTransactionManager) is necessary for accessing multiple transactional resources within the same transaction. Note that you need to configure your JPA provider accordingly in order to make it participate in JTA transactions.\n\nWhat this means is that you will need to provide a JTA transaction manager. In our application, we use config similar to the following:\n\nIf you are deploying within an appserver, then the spring JtaTransactionManager needs to do a lookup to the real XA-compliant JTA transaction manager provided by the appserver. However, you can also use a standalone JTA transaction manager (but I haven't tried this myself yet)\nAs for configuring the Jpa persistence provider, I'm not that familiar. What JPA persistence provider are you using?\nThe code above is based on our approach, where we were using native Hibernate as opposed to Hibernate's JPA implementation. In this case, we were able to get rid of the two HibernateTransactionManager beans, and simply ensure that both SessionFactories were injected with the same JTA TM, and then use the tx:annotation-driven element.\nHope this helps\n", 
        "The only situation in which you can have two Spring transaction managers is if you never have both transactions open at one time.  This is not intrinsically to do with distributed transactions - the same restrictions apply even if you want the two datasources to have completely separate (but potentially overlapping in time) transaction lifecyles.\nInternally Spring's transaction managers all use Spring's TransactionSynchronizationManager which keeps a bunch of critical state in static ThreadLocal variables, so transaction managers are guaranteed to stomp all over each other's state.\n",

        "An array of ints in java is stored as a block of 32-bit values in memory. How is an array of Integer objects stored? i.e.\n\nI'd imagine that each element in the Integer array is a reference to an Integer object, and that the Integer object has object storage overheads, just like any other object.\nI'm hoping however that the JVM does some magical cleverness under the hood given that Integers are immutable and stores it just like an array of ints.\nIs my hope woefully naive? Is an Integer array much slower than an int array in an application where every last ounce of performance matters?\n", 
        "I think your hope is woefully naive. Specifically, it needs to deal with the issue that Integer can potentially be null, whereas int can not be. That alone is reason enough to store the object pointer.\nThat said, the actual object pointer will be to a immutable int instance, notably for a select subset of integers.\n", 
        "It won't be much slower, but because an Integer[] must accept \"null\" as an entry and int[] doesn't have to, there will be some amount of bookkeeping involved, even if Integer[] is backed by an int[].\nSo if every last ounce of performance matters, user int[]\n", 
        "The reason that Integer can be null, whereas int cannot, is because Integer is a full-fledged Java object, with all of the overhead that includes. There's value in this since you can write\n\nwhich is good for saying that foo will have a value, but it doesn't yet. \nAnother difference is that int performs no overflow calculation. For instance,\n\nwill merrily increment bar and you end up with a very negative number, which is probably not what you intended in the first place.\n\nwill complain, which I think would be better behavior. \nOne last point is that Integer, being a Java object, carries with it the space overhead of an object. I think that someone else may need to chime in here, but I believe that every object consumes 12 bytes for overhead, and then the space for the data storage itself. If you're after performance and space, I wonder whether Integer is the right solution.\n", 
        "John Rose working on fixnums in the JVM to fix this problem.\n", 
        "No VM I know of will store an Integer[] array like an int[] array for the following reasons:\n\nThere can be null Integer objects in the array and you have no bits left for indicating this in an int array. The VM could store this 1-bit information per array slot in a hiden bit-array though.\nYou can synchronize in the elements of an Integer array. This is much harder to overcome as the first point, since you would have to store a monitor object for each array slot.\nThe elements of Integer[] can be compared for identity. You could for example create two Integer objects with the value 1 via new and store them in different array slots and later you retrieve them and compare them via ==. This must lead to false, so you would have to store this information somewhere. Or you keep a reference to one of the Integer objects somewhere and use this for comparison and you have to make sure one of the == comparisons is false and one true. This means the whole concept of object identity is quiet hard to handle for the optimized Integer array.\nYou can cast an Integer[] to e.g. Object[] and pass it to methods expecting just an Object[]. This means all the code which handles Object[] must now be able to handle the special Integer[] object too, making it slower and larger.\n\nTaking all this into account, it would probably be possible to make a special Integer[] which saves some space in comparison to a naive implementation, but the additional complexity will likely affect a lot of other code, making it slower in the end.\nThe overhead of using Integer[] instead of int[] can be quiet large in space and time. On a typical 32 bit VM an Integer object will consume 16 byte (8 byte for the object header, 4 for the payload and 4 additional bytes for alignment) while the Integer[] uses as much space as int[]. In 64 bit VMs (using 64bit pointers, which is not always the case) an Integer object will consume 24 byte (16 for the header, 4 for the payload and 4 for alignment). In addition a slot in the Integer[] will use 8 byte instead of 4 as in the int[]. This means you can expect an overhead of 16 to 28 byte per slot, which is a factor of 4 to 7 compared to plain int arrays.\nThe performance overhead can be significant too for mainly two reasons:\n\nSince you use more memory, you put on much more pressure on the memory subsystem, making it more likely to have cache misses in the case of Integer[]. For example if you traverse the contents of the int[] in a linear manner, the cache will have most of the entries already fetched when you need them (since the layout is linear too). But in case of the Integer array, the Integer objects itself might be scattered randomly in the heap, making it hard for the cache to guess where the next memory reference will point to.\nThe garbage collection has to do much more work because of the additional memory used and because it has to scan and move each Integer object separately, while in the case of int[] it is just one object and the contents of the object doesn't have to be scanned (they contain no reference to other objects).\n\nTo sum it up, using an int[] in performance critical work will be both much faster and memory efficient than using an Integer array in current VMs and it is unlikely this will change much in the near future.\n",

So for a user-defined type named 'Complex', assignment means to copy a reference to an existing value.\nconsider instead:\n\nIn C++, this copies the value, so the comparison will result not-equal.  In Java, operator= performs reference copy, so 'a' and 'b' are now referring to the same value.  As a result, the comparison will produce 'equal', since the object will compare equal to itself.\nThe difference between copies and references only adds to the confusion of operator overloading.  As Sebastian mentioned, Java and C# both have to deal with value and reference equality separately -- operator+ would likely deal with values and objects, but operator= is already implemented to deal with references.\nIn C++, you should only be dealing with one kind of comparison at a time, so it can be less confusing.

But you could lie. And create a different object. In fact, this interface is so weak you could return another type of object altogether, just for the fun of it:\n\nAs the Cloneable interface can be abused/obfuscated, should it be banned on the same grounds C++ operator overloading is supposed to be?\nWe could overload the toString() method of a MyComplexNumber class to have it return the stringified hour of the day. Should the toString() overloading be banned, too? We could sabotage MyComplexNumber.equals to have it return a random value, modify the operands... etc. etc. etc..\nIn Java, as in C++, or whatever language, the programmer must respect a minimum of semantics when writing code. This means implementing a add function that adds, and Cloneable implementation method that clones, and a ++ operator than increments.\nWhat's obfuscating anyway?\nNow that we know that code can be sabotaged even through the pristine Java methods, we can ask ourselves about the real use of operator overloading in C++?\nClear and natural notation: methods vs. operator overloading?\nWe'll compare below, for different cases, the \"same\" code in Java and C++, to have an idea of which kind of coding style is clearer.\nNatural comparisons:\n\nPlease note that A and B could be of any type in C++, as long as the operator overloads are provided. In Java, when A and B are not primitives, the code can become very confusing, even for primitive-like objects (BigInteger, etc.)...\nNatural array/container accessors and subscripting:\n\nIn Java, we see that for each container to do the same thing (access its content through an index or identifier), we have a different way to do it, which is confusing.\nIn C++, each container uses the same way to access its content, thanks to operator overloading.\nNatural advanced types manipulation\nThe examples below use a Matrix object, found using the first links found on Google for \"Java Matrix object\" and \"c++ Matrix object\":\n\nAnd this is not limited to matrices.

Did we find them confusing, them?\nOperator overloading depends on its operands\nThis is the most important part of operator overloading: Like in mathematics, or in physics, the operation depends on its operands' types.\nSo, know the type of the operand, and you will know the effect of the operation.\nEven C and Java have (hard-coded) operator overloading\nIn C, the real behavior of an operator will change according to its operands. For example, adding two integers is different than adding two doubles, or even one integer and one double. There is even the whole pointer arithmetic domain (without casting, you can add to a pointer an integer, but you cannot add two pointers...).\nIn Java, there is no pointer arithmetic, but someone still found string concatenation without the + operator would be ridiculous enough to justify an exception in the \"operator overloading is evil\" creed.\nIt's just that you, as a C (for historical reasons) or Java (for personal reasons, see below) coder, you can't provide your own.\nIn C++, operator overloading is not optional...\nIn C++, operator overloading for built-in types is not possible (and this is a good thing), but user-defined types can have user-defined operator overloads.\nAs already said earlier, in C++, and to the contrary to Java, user-types are not considered second-class citizens of the language, when compared to built-in types. So, if built-in types have operators, user types should be able to have them, too.\nThe truth is that, like the toString(), clone(), equals() methods are for Java (i.e. quasi-standard-like), C++ operator overloading is so much part of C++ that it becomes as natural as the original C operators, or the before mentioned Java methods.\nCombined with template programming, operator overloading becomes a well known design pattern. In fact, you cannot go very far in STL without using overloaded operators, and overloading operators for your own class.\n...but it should not be abused\nOperator overloading should strive to respect the semantics of the operator. Do not subtract in a + operator (as in \"do not subtract in a add function\", or \"return crap in a clone method\").\nCast overloading can be very dangerous because they can lead to ambiguities. So they should really be reserved for well defined cases. As for && and ||, do not ever overload them unless you really know what you're doing, as you'll lose the the short circuit evaluation that the native operators && and || enjoy.\nSo... Ok... Then why it is not possible in Java?\nBecause James Gosling said so:\n\nI left out operator overloading as a fairly personal choice because I had seen too many people abuse it in C++.\nJames Gosling. Source: http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c_family_interview.htm\n\nPlease compare Gosling's text above with Stroustrup's below:\n\nMany C++ design decisions have their roots in my dislike for forcing people to do things in some particular way [...] Often, I was tempted to outlaw a feature I personally disliked, I refrained from doing so because I did not think I had the right to force my views on others.\nBjarne Stroustrup. Source: The Desing and Evolution of C++ (1.3 General Background)\n\nWould operator overloading benefit Java?\nSome objects would greatly benefit from operator overloading (concrete or numerical types, like BigDecimal, complex numbers, matrices, containers, iterators, comparators, parsers etc.).\nIn C++, you can profit from this benefit because of Stroustrup's humility. In Java, you're simply screwed because of Gosling's personal choice.\nCould it be added to Java?\nThe reasons for not adding operator overloading now in Java could be a mix of internal politics, allergy to the feature, distrust of developers (you know, the saboteur ones that seem to haunt Java teams...), compatibility with the previous JVMs, time to write a correct specification, etc..\nSo don't hold your breath waiting for this feature...\nBut they do it in C#!!!\nYeah...\nWhile this is far from being the only difference between the two languages, this one never fails to amuse me.\nApparently, the C# folks, with their \"every primitive is a struct, and a struct derives from Object\", got it right at first try.\nAnd they do it in other languages!!!\nDespite all the FUD against used defined operator overloading, the following languages support it: Scala, Dart, Python, F#, C#, D, Algol 68, Smalltalk, Groovy, Perl 6, C++, Ruby, Haskell, MATLAB, Eiffel, Lua, Clojure, Fortran 90, Swift, Ada, Delphi 2005...\nSo many languages, with so many different (and sometimes opposing) philosophies, and yet they all agree on that point.\nFood for thought...\n", 
        "I intend to develop a system that is entirely based on modules. The system base should have support for finding out about plugins, starting them up and being able to provide ways for those modules to communicate. Ideally, one should be able to put in new modules and yank out unused modules at will, and modules should be able to use each other's funcionality if it is available.\nThis system should be used as a basis for simulation systems where a lot of stuff happens in different modules, and other modules might want to do something based on that.\nThe system I intend to develop is going to be in Java. The way I see it, I intend to have a folder with a subfolder for each module that includes a XML that describes the module with information such as name, maybe which events it might raise, stuff like that. I suppose I might need to write a custom ClassLoader to work this stuff out.\nThe thing is, I don't know if my idea actually holds any water and, of course, I intend on building a working prototype. However, I never worked on a truly modular system before, and I'm not really sure what is the best way to take on this problem.\nWhere should I start? Are there common problems and pitfalls that are found while developing this kind of system? How do I make the modules talk with each other while maintaining isolation (i.e, you remove a module and another module that was using it stays sane)? Are there any guides, specifications or articles I can read that could give me some ideas on where to start? It would be better if they were based on Java, but this is not a requirement, as what I'm looking for right now are ideas, not code.\nAny feedback is appreciated.\n", 
        "Without getting into great detail, you should be looking at Spring and a familiarization with OSGI or the Eclipse RCP frameworks will also give you some fundamental concepts you will need to keep in mind.\n", 
        "They are many way to do it but something simple can be by using Reflection. You write in your XML file name of file (that would be a class in reallity). You can than check what type is it and create it back with reflection. The class could have a common Interface that will let you find if the external file/class is really one of your module. Here is some information about Reflexion.\nYou can also use a precoded framework like this SourceForge onelink text that will give you a first good step to create module/plugin.\n", 
        "You should definitely look at OSGi. It aims at being the component/plugin mechanism for Java. It allows you to modularize your code (in so-called bundles) and update bundles at runtime. You can also completely hide implementation packages from unwanted access by other bundles, eg. only provide the API.\nEclipse was the first major open-source project to implement and use OSGi, but they didn't fully leverage it (no plugin installations/updates without restarts). If you start from scratch though, it will give you a very good framework for a plugin system.\nApache Felix is a complete open-source implementation (and there are others, such as Eclipse Equinox).\n",

        "I'm looking around for a Java code signing certificate so my Java applets don't throw up such scary security warnings. However, all the places I've found offering them charge (in my opinion) way too much, like over USD200 per year. While doing research, a code signing certificate seems almost exactly the same as an SSL certificate.\nThe main question I have: is it possible to buy an SSL certificate, but use it to sign Java applets?\n", 
        "Short answer: No, they're different.\nLong answer: It's the same sort of certificate and it uses the same crypto software, but the certificate has flags indicating what it is allowed to be used for.  Code signing and web server are different uses.  \n", 
        "When I import a new CA certificate in Firefox (etc.) I have the option of choosing which certificate uses I trust:\n\nSign servers\nSign code (like your applet)\nSign email certificates\n\nSo to me the answer is: Yes, they're the same. Furthermore, why not generate your own with OpenSSL  (man openssl, man x509, man req, etc. on Unix)? Do you want to just quiet down the warnings or do you want other people whom you've never met to trust your code? If you don't need other users to chain trust to the anchor CA's bundled with their browser, OS, etc., then use OpenSSL to generate your own.\nAnd ask \"How do I use OpenSSL to generate my own certificates?\" if the latter is your choice.\n", 
        "Thawte offers code signing certificates here. I imagine other Certificate Authorities offer this service as well. You can also create self-signed certificates, with Java keytool.\n"
